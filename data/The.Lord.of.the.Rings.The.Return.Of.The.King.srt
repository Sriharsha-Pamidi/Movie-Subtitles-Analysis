1
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,912
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,414
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,959
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,254
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,306
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,531
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,328
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,221
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,477
Why?

10
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,814
Because...

11
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,734
it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:52,042
My precious.

13
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,511
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,054
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,681
"Murderer” they called us.

16
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,645
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,481
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,358
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,360
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,033
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,787
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,168
And cool
So nice for feet.

23
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,549
And we only wish
To catch a fish.

24
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,969
So juicy sweet.

25
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,854
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,649
the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,736
the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:08,034
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:22,591
My precious.

30
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,095
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,806
Wake up!

32
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,767
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,810
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,647
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,278
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,033
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,161
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,829
No.

39
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,915
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,126
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,379
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,344
Come on!

43
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,015
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,559
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,604
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,656
Here.

47
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,703
What about you?

48
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,248
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,208
Sam.

50
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,337
All right.

51
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,007
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,051
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,140
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,725
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,893
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,272
For what?

57
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,692
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,869
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,122
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,542
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,378
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,714
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,810
It's good.

64
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,479
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,817
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,493
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,831
- Mmm. Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,585
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,631
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,480
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,899
to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,028
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:59,200
and now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

74
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,579
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,207
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,129
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,048
Salted pork?

78
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,678
- Huh. Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,681
who's taken over management
of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,228
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,983
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,571
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,408
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,577
locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,581
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,541
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,961
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,214
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,466
No.

90
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,135
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,680
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,811
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,480
and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,568
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,988
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,032
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,332
when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,210
and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,173
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,384
whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,096
against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:50,228
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,398
we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,861
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,446
Dotard!

107
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,742
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,246
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,374
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,545
along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,631
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,217
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,720
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,222
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,642
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,395
I have some for you.

117
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,778
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,239
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,245
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,958
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,088
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,426
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,140
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,936
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:20,193
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,198
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,326
those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,956
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,501
before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:44,300
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,803
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,805
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,973
No.

134
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,643
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,730
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,232
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,992
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,995
your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,511
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,348
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,351
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,727
Come down.

143
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,605
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,775
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,612
but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,533
and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:57,498
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,712
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,716
Gríma...

150
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,427
come down.

151
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,220
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,391
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,394
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,397
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,233
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,903
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,618
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,746
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,067
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,111
and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,782
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,888
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,892
Is washing away.

164
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,647
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,316
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,652
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,330
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,332
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,168
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,170
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:03,934
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,646
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,230
Hail!

174
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,118
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,456
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,625
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,796
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,302
What'll we drink
to? Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,804
To victory!

180
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,474
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,269
He is an honorable man.

182
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,147
You are both honorable men.

183
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:38,320
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,330
Ah, don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,666
You are young.

186
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,169
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,185
Here, here.

188
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:16,567
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,199
I feel something.

190
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,870
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,122
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,751
What did I say?

193
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,254
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,930
Game over.

195
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,474
Oh, you can search far and wide.

196
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,100
You can drink the whole town dry.

197
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,646
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown.

198
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,234
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown.

199
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,279
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon.

200
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,616
But the only brew for the brave and true.

201
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,578
Pippin!

202
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,082
But the only brew for the brave and true.

203
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,459
Comes from The Green Dragon

204
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,632
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,928
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,598
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,601
We have time.

208
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,398
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,192
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,781
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,125
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,129
Yes.

213
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,675
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,972
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,348
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,559
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,812
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,151
Shh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,820
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,072
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,158
They knows.

222
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,952
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,665
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,461
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,505
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,885
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:52,890
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,601
And we will.

229
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,855
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,861
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,697
Ours!

232
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,701
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

233
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,246
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,793
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,715
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

236
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,551
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:39,269
until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,773
And when they go in...

240
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,734
there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,571
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,493
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,078
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,414
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,291
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

246
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,585
No.

247
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:08,424
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,427
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,429
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,434
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,645
then we will find it.

252
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:26,150
And take it for me!

253
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,319
For us.

254
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,823
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,452
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:41,123
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,794
once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,796
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,801
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,595
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,140
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,478
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,523
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,317
who hates Sméagol...

265
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,236
and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,114
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,741
Sam!

268
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,701
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,332
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,668
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,337
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,172
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,760
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,514
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,642
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,063
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,607
Trust me.

278
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,193
Come, Sméagol.

279
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,596
What time is it?

280
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,433
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,359
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,530
climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

283
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,284
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,330
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

285
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,043
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,129
but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,674
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,845
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
Sleep, Éowyn.

290
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,184
Sleep...

291
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,813
while you can.

292
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,215
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,719
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,515
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,395
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,536
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,625
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,884
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,065
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,402
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,653
Just one more time.

302
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,989
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,084
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,092
No!

305
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,515
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,020
He is here.

307
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,481
I see you.

308
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,110
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,503
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,131
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,722
Pippin!

312
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,100
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,415
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,504
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,548
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,550
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,139
A tree.

318
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,975
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,643
in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,730
It was dead.

321
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,736
The city was burning.

322
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,282
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,993
I saw...

324
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,747
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,003
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,589
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,591
Speak!

328
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,931
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,558
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,186
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,150
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,236
A fool...

333
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,697
but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,701
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,121
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:22,167
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:27,047
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,384
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,887
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

340
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,181
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,143
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,229
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,733
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,320
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

345
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,990
before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,078
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,206
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,168
why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,882
What do we owe Gondor?

350
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,052
- I will go.
- No!

351
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,389
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

352
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,353
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

353
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,358
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,278
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,115
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,702
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,623
and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,045
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,715
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,634
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,052
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,972
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,225
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

364
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,102
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,107
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

366
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,818
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,739
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,826
And you...? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,455
Merry?

370
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,914
Come on.

371
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,796
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,591
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

373
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,261
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,472
Here.

375
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,432
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,268
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:49,439
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,108
But... But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,947
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

380
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,993
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,870
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,497
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,582
Merry!

384
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,177
Merry!

385
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,147
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,858
everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,985
Since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,074
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,326
but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,664
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,252
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,630
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,465
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,720
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,486
Take her by the safest road.

396
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,156
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

397
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,201
It waits to carry her across the sea.

398
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,747
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

399
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,440
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,151
only death.

401
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,743
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,579
we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,291
My lady!

404
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,313
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

405
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,401
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,363
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

408
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,032
But there is also life.

409
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,997
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,166
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,335
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,132
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,553
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,184
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,979
I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,399
It is time.

417
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,450
From the ashes a fire shall be woken.

418
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,037
A light from the shadow shall spring.

419
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,498
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

420
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,092
The crownless again shall be king.

421
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,890
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,469
Your hands are cold.

423
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,976
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

424
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,314
This was my choice.

425
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,443
Whether by your will or not...

426
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:33,074
there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

427
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,124
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

428
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,013
Minas Tirith.

429
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,932
City of kings.

430
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,091
Make way!

431
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,122
It's the tree.

432
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,957
Gandalf. Gandalf.

433
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,376
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

434
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,378
The tree of the king.

435
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,214
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

436
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,050
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

437
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,346
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

438
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,684
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

439
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,604
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

440
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,233
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

441
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,947
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

442
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:54,609
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

443
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,827
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

444
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,165
Perhaps you come to explain this.

445
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:19,342
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

446
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,817
Boromir died to save us...

447
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,653
my kinsman and me.

448
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,323
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

449
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,290
I offer you my service, such as it is...

450
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,834
in payment of this debt.

451
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,340
This is my first command to you.

452
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,511
How did you escape
and my son did not...

453
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,180
SO mighty a man as he was”?

454
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,184
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

455
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,353
and Boromir was pierced by many.

456
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,192
Get up.

457
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,989
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

458
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,199
but it is not now.

459
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,119
War is coming.

460
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,873
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

461
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,211
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

462
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:42,258
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

463
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:46,929
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

464
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,059
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

465
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,271
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

466
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:01,569
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

467
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,822
I have seen more than you know.

468
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,200
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

469
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,245
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

470
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:15,124
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

471
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:21,255
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

472
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:26,260
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

473
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:30,931
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

474
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:36,937
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

475
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,525
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

476
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,491
Come.

477
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,001
All has turned to vain ambition.

478
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,630
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

479
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,302
A thousand years
this city has stood.

480
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,806
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

481
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,226
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

482
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,936
will never bloom again.

483
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,813
Why are they still guarding it?

484
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,023
They guard it because they have hope.

485
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,818
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

486
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,739
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

487
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,826
before it fell into decay.

488
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,246
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

489
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:39,708
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

490
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,836
and counted the old names
of their descent...

491
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,797
dearer than the names of their sons.

492
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:50,010
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

493
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:55,516
or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

494
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,478
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

495
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,773
The line of kings failed.

496
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,860
The White Tree withered.

497
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,739
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

498
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,710
Mordor.

499
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,881
Yes, there it lies.

500
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,051
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

501
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,722
A storm is coming.

502
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,309
This is not the weather of the world.

503
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,686
This is a device of Sauron's making.

504
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,607
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

505
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,651
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

506
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,653
SO he covers the face of the sun...

507
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,574
to ease their passage
along the road to war.

508
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:57,036
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

509
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,455
it will begin.

510
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,708
Well...

511
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,418
Minas Tirith...

512
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,713
very impressive.

513
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,641
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

514
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,927
There's no leaving this city.

515
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,390
Help must come to us.

516
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,645
It must be getting near teatime.

517
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,524
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

518
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,277
We're not in decent places.

519
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,076
Mr. Frodo?

520
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,330
What is it?

521
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,168
It's just a feeling.

522
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,756
I don't think I'll be coming back.

523
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,805
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

524
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,307
That's just morbid thinking.

525
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,227
We're going there and back again...

526
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,688
just like Mr. Bilbo.

527
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,774
You'll see.

528
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,578
I think these lands
were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.

529
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:29,003
Long ago, when there was a king.

530
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,484
Mr. Frodo, look.

531
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,864
The king has got a crown again.

532
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,254
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

533
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,150
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

534
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:37,571
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

535
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,659
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

536
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,204
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

537
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,752
Ridiculous Hobbit.

538
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,130
Guard of the Citadel.

539
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,475
Thank you.

540
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,112
There's no more stars.

541
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,822
Is it time?

542
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,741
Yes.

543
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,037
It's so quiet.

544
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,292
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

545
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,338
I don't want to be in a battle...

546
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:42,136
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

547
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:49,309
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

548
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,772
There never was much hope.

549
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,484
Just a fool's hope.

550
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,160
Our enemy is ready.

551
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,996
His full strength's gathered.

552
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,666
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

553
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,878
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

554
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,756
mercenaries from the coast.

555
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,508
All will answer Mordor's call.

556
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,218
Come on.

557
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,681
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

558
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:31,226
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

559
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,523
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

560
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,360
the last defense of this city
will be gone.

561
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,573
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

562
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,039
Gandalf?

563
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,421
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

564
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,717
the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

565
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:09,056
The one they say no living man can Kill.

566
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,226
The Witch-king of Angmar.

567
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,687
You've met him before.

568
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,941
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

569
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,200
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

570
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,119
the greatest of the Nine.

571
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,832
Minas Morgul is his lair.

572
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,922
The Dead City.

573
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,302
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

574
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,687
Quick. Quick.

575
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:00,858
They will see. They will see.

576
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:15,414
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

577
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:19,459
The way into Mordor.

578
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,964
The secret stair.

579
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,758
Climb.

580
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,781
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

581
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,497
- What's it doing?
- No.

582
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,751
- They're calling me.
- No.

583
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,367
Hide! Hide!

584
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,746
I can feel his blade.

585
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,552
We come to it at last.

586
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,265
The great battle of our time.

587
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,682
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

588
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,570
The board is set.

589
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,114
The pieces are moving.

590
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,495
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

591
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,331
And then it's into the tunnel.

592
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,709
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

593
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,004
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

594
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,091
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

595
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,842
One sniff something's not right...

596
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,179
one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

597
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,057
No more slinker. No more stinker.

598
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,018
You're gone. Got it?

599
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,896
I'm watching you.

600
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,237
What was that about?

601
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,823
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

602
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,332
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

603
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:32,087
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

604
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,510
You must not fail me.

605
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,839
It's been very quiet across the river.

606
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,341
The Orcs are lying low.

607
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,510
The garrison may have moved out.

608
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,347
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

609
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,834
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

610
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,336
Quiet.

611
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,383
We need 10 more.

612
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,240
Kill him!

613
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,968
They're not coming from the north.

614
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:48,723
- To the river. Quick. Quick.
- Go. Come on.

615
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,770
Faster.

616
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,286
Draw swords.

617
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,426
Hold! Hold them!

618
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,591
What?

619
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,564
Amon Din.

620
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,406
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon dîn is lit.

621
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,872
Hope is kindled.

622
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:35,635
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

623
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,471
Gondor calls for aid.

624
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,901
And Rohan will answer.

625
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,113
Muster the Rohirrim.

626
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,171
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

627
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:16,718
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

628
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:22,181
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

629
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,350
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

630
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,935
- Gamling.
- My lord.

631
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,729
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

632
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,023
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

633
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,774
I will.

634
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,032
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

635
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,119
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

636
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,586
The men have found their captain.

637
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:55,089
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

638
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,841
You have given us hope.

639
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,013
Excuse me.

640
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,849
I have a sword.

641
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,517
Please accept it.

642
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:12,148
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

643
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,654
And gladly I accept it.

644
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:22,825
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

645
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,915
Horse-Men.

646
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:35,213
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

647
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,549
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

648
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,136
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

649
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:04,075
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

650
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:08,121
the doom of our time will be decided.

651
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:16,254
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

652
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:20,800
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land! Hyah!

653
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,011
Faramir!

654
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:15,021
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

655
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,691
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

656
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,702
Nazgûl.

657
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,540
Take cover!

658
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,251
Nazgûl!

659
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:41,088
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

660
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,555
Fall back!

661
01:11:56,604 --> 01:12:01,192
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

662
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,762
The age of Men is over.

663
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:35,560
The time of the Orc has come.

664
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,273
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgûl.

665
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,277
Take cover, my lord!

666
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,903
It's coming!

667
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,829
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

668
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,162
Pull!

669
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,307
Mithrandir.

670
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,225
They broke through our defenses.

671
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,603
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

672
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,689
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

673
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,858
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

674
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:10,571
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

675
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,369
Faramir?

676
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,124
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

677
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,502
No.

678
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,380
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

679
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,676
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

680
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,928
Not two days ago.

681
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:38,849
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

682
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,186
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

683
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,774
What does that mean?

684
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:51,862
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

685
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,073
Tell me all you know.

686
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,661
This is how you would serve your city?

687
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,123
You would risk its utter ruin?

688
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,750
I did what I judged to be right.

689
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,462
What you judged to be right.

690
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:14,969
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

691
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,769
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

692
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,939
Hidden.

693
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,109
Dark and deep in the vaults...

694
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,445
not to be used.

695
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:41,495
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

696
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,998
I would not use the Ring.

697
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:47,251
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

698
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:52,423
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

699
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,842
as a king of old.

700
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,389
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

701
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,267
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

702
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,020
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

703
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:09,708
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

704
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,532
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

705
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,030
And when he returned...

706
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,824
you would not have known your son.

707
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,535
Boromir was loyal to me!

708
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,288
Not some wizard's pupil!

709
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,756
Father?

710
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,354
My son.

711
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,965
Leave me.

712
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,084
Careful, master. Careful.

713
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,337
Very far to fall.

714
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,760
Very dangerous are the stairs.

715
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,974
Come, master.

716
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,941
Come to Sméagol.

717
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,782
Mr. Frodo.

718
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,327
Get back, you!

719
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,704
Don't touch him!

720
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,669
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

721
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,548
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

722
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,050
Master?

723
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:46,347
Master carries heavy burden.

724
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:51,936
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

725
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:55,356
Fat one cannot know.

726
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,152
Sméagol look after master.

727
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,572
He wants it.

728
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:08,285
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

729
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:13,916
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

730
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,962
The fat one will take it from you.

731
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,515
Send forth all legions.

732
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:33,727
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

733
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,564
Slay them all.

734
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:45,030
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

735
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,786
Where are Théoden's riders?

736
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,539
Will Rohan's army come?

737
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,958
Mithrandir.

738
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,879
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

739
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,387
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

740
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:16,186
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

741
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,855
It was well-done.

742
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:25,070
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

743
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,365
You are to join the tower guard.

744
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,910
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

745
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,538
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

746
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,248
A very foolish one...

747
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,669
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

748
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,589
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

749
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,549
My father had it made for me.

750
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,926
Well...

751
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,095
I'm taller than you were then.

752
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,599
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

753
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,604
Never fitted me either.

754
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:01,607
Boromir was always the soldier.

755
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,029
They were so alike, he and my father.

756
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,741
Proud.

757
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,117
Stubborn even.

758
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,371
But strong.

759
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:20,042
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

760
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,128
And one day your father will see it.

761
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:31,095
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

762
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,763
in peace or war...

763
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:35,849
in living or dying...

764
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,477
from...

765
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,941
From this hour henceforth...

766
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,026
until my lord release me...

767
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,738
or death take me.

768
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,825
And I shall not forget it...

769
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:56,370
nor fail to reward
that which is given.

770
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,255
Fealty with love.

771
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,007
Valor with honor.

772
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,929
Disloyalty with vengeance.

773
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:26,650
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

774
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,570
defenses that your brother
long held intact.

775
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:32,239
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

776
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,200
the river in Pelennor unfought.

777
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,035
Osgiliath must be retaken.

778
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,246
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

779
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,708
Much must be risked in war.

780
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:49,298
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

781
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:58,765
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

782
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,561
that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

783
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,733
Yes.

784
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,611
I wish that.

785
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,497
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

786
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,251
I will do what I can
in his stead.

787
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,889
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

788
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,603
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

789
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,872
Ugh.

790
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,230
What are you up to?

791
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,648
Sneaking off, are we?

792
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,192
Sneaking?

793
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,362
Sneaking?

794
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,950
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

795
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:27,205
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

796
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,541
and they say "sneak."

797
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,753
Sneak?

798
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,089
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

799
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,884
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

800
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,346
You just startled me is all.

801
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,681
What were you doing?

802
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,435
Sneaking.

803
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,897
Fine. Have it your own way.

804
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,652
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

805
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,987
We have to be moving on.

806
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,744
It's dark still.

807
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,121
It's always dark here.

808
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,294
It's gone!

809
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,382
- The Elven bread.
- What?

810
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:20,008
That's all we have left.

811
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,598
He took it. He must have!

812
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,352
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

813
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,438
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

814
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,775
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

815
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,485
He doesn't eat it.

816
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,822
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

817
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,700
What's this?

818
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,706
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

819
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,083
He took it.

820
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:58,130
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

821
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,090
That's a filthy lie!

822
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,467
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

823
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:03,885
- Sam!
- Call me...

824
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,303
Stop it!

825
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,640
Sam!

826
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:12,436
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

827
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:19,025
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

828
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,319
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

829
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,572
- I'm all right.
- No.

830
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,825
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

831
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,119
It's that Gollum.

832
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,996
It's this place.

833
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,749
It's that thing around your neck.

834
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,545
I could help a bit.

835
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,381
I could carry it for a while.

836
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,300
Carry it for a while.

837
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,947
I could carry it... I could carry it.

838
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:50,807
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

839
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,184
Get away!

840
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,990
I don't want to keep it.

841
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,524
I just want to help.

842
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:04,196
See? See?

843
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:07,783
He wants it for himself.

844
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,659
Shut up, you!

845
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,037
Go away!
Get out of here!

846
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,039
No, Sam.

847
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,457
It's you.

848
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,379
I'm sorry, Sam.

849
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,424
But he's a liar.

850
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:27,260
He's poisoned you against me.

851
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,597
You can't help me anymore.

852
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,434
You don't mean that.

853
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,730
Go home.

854
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,562
Faramir!

855
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,647
Faramir!

856
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,192
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

857
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,404
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

858
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,490
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

859
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,036
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

860
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,456
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

861
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:22,834
her memory, her wisdom.

862
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:28,632
Your father loves you, Faramir.

863
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,344
He will remember it
before the end.

864
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,498
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

865
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,877
Well...

866
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,046
yes.

867
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:54,509
At least, well enough
for my own people.

868
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,555
But we have no songs
for great halls...

869
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,849
and evil times.

870
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:04,853
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

871
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,065
Come, sing me a song.

872
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,455
Home is behind.

873
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:27,375
The world ahead.

874
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:35,633
And there are many paths to tread.

875
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:40,972
Through shadow.

876
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:45,310
To the edge of night.

877
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:52,067
Until the stars are all alight.

878
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:59,407
Mist and shadow.

879
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:03,870
Cloud and shade.

880
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,584
All shall fade.

881
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,965
All shall

882
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,099
Fade

883
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:51,960
March! March!

884
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:57,257
March! March! March!

885
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,138
Make way for the king.

886
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,641
Make way.

887
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,146
The king is here.

888
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,732
My lord.

889
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,944
Hail to you, sire.

890
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,612
Grimbold, how many?

891
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:22,240
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

892
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,869
We have 300 more
from Fenmarch, Théoden King.

893
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:30,957
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

894
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,143
Six thousand spears.

895
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,188
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

896
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,858
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

897
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:01,362
More will come.

898
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:04,699
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

899
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,452
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

900
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,265
The horses are restless...

901
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,934
and the men are quiet.

902
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:34,520
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

903
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,858
That road there...

904
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,861
where does that lead?

905
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:46,449
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

906
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,161
None who venture there ever return.

907
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,248
That mountain is evil.

908
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,678
Hold!

909
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,022
Aragorn.

910
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,692
Let's find some food.

911
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,626
There.

912
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:42,547
A true esquire of Rohan.

913
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,885
I'm ready.

914
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,055
Sorry.

915
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,516
It isn't all that dangerous.

916
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:56,352
It's not even sharp.

917
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,398
Well, that's no good. You won't Kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

918
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,066
Come on.

919
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,740
To the smithy. Go!

920
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,744
You should not encourage him.

921
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:15,413
You should not doubt him.

922
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,875
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

923
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,171
Why should Merry be left behind?

924
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,965
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

925
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,262
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

926
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,560
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

927
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,897
When the fear takes him...

928
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:46,110
and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

929
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,613
do you think he would stand and fight?

930
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,784
He would flee.

931
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,036
And he would be right to do so.

932
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:01,209
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

933
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:40,581
I choose a mortal life.

934
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,337
I wish I could've seen him...

935
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:50,174
one last time.

936
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,812
Sir?

937
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:07,191
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

938
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,964
I take my leave.

939
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:45,855
My lord Elrond.

940
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,901
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

941
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:55,031
Arwen is dying.

942
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:03,873
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

943
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:08,002
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

944
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:12,173
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

945
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:16,093
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

946
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:19,430
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

947
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,432
The end has come.

948
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,435
It will not be our end, but his.

949
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:28,773
You ride to war, but not to victory.

950
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:33,444
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

951
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:38,074
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

952
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:41,953
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

953
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,664
They'll be in the city in two days.

954
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:47,959
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

955
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,795
You need more men.

956
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:52,964
There are none.

957
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,636
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

958
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:09,814
Murderers...

959
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,399
traitors.

960
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,987
You would call upon them to fight?

961
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,780
They believe in nothing.

962
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:20,074
They answer to no one.

963
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,327
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

964
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:35,590
Andúril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

965
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:54,317
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

966
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:13,127
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

967
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,713
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

968
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,759
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

969
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,721
Put aside the Ranger.

970
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:27,224
Become who you were born to be.

971
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,393
Take the Dimholt road.

972
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,088
Why are you doing this?

973
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:00,800
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

974
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,304
You cannot abandon the men.

975
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,182
Éowyn...

976
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,559
We need you here.

977
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,562
Why have you come?

978
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,191
Do you not know?

979
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:29,453
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

980
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:35,835
I cannot give you what you seek.

981
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:53,269
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

982
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,665
Just where do you think you're off to?

983
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,167
Not this time.

984
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,586
- This time you must stay, Gimli.
- Mm.

985
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:24,133
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

986
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,970
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

987
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,453
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

988
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,663
Where's he going?

989
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,293
I don't understand.

990
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,508
Lord Aragorn!

991
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:08,636
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

992
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:11,931
He leaves because there is no hope.

993
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,725
He leaves because he must.

994
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,560
Too few have come.

995
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,938
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

996
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,067
No...

997
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,735
we cannot.

998
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:31,450
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

999
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:47,591
I have left instruction.

1000
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,556
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

1001
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:02,398
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1002
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:06,443
Long may you defend Edoras...

1003
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,988
if the battle goes ill.

1004
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:13,492
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1005
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,621
Duty?

1006
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,125
No.

1007
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,594
I would have you smile again...

1008
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:40,019
not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1009
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:48,319
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1010
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:55,451
and no more despair.

1011
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:05,336
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1012
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,338
One that is cursed.

1013
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,842
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1014
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:15,054
to the last king of Gondor...

1015
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,181
to come to his aid...

1016
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:19,099
to fight.

1017
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,769
But when the time came...

1018
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:25,022
when Gondor's need was dire...

1019
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:27,024
they fled...

1020
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,611
vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1021
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:33,989
And so Isildur cursed them...

1022
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:39,370
never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1023
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,877
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1024
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,546
The forgotten people.

1025
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,216
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1026
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,593
From the north shall he come.

1027
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:56,720
Need shall drive him.

1028
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:01,350
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1029
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:23,122
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1030
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,629
The way is shut.

1031
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,340
It was made by those
who are dead.

1032
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,218
And the Dead keep it.

1033
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,262
The way is shut.

1034
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,150
Brego!

1035
01:48:54,653 --> 01:48:57,364
I do not fear death.

1036
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:12,087
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1037
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:16,925
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1038
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:18,427
Oh.

1039
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:21,430
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1040
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,655
We must ride light and swift.

1041
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,616
It is a long road ahead.

1042
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:43,827
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1043
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:52,336
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1044
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:54,671
All my friends have gone to battle.

1045
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,757
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1046
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:59,009
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1047
01:49:59,218 --> 01:50:01,595
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1048
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,723
I want to fight.

1049
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,226
I will say no more.

1050
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:25,994
Ride with me.

1051
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:28,872
My lady.

1052
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,375
Form up! Move out!

1053
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,795
Form up! Move out!

1054
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:39,049
Ride!

1055
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:42,219
Ride now to Gondor!

1056
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:25,596
What is it?

1057
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:27,306
What do you see?

1058
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:29,683
I see shapes of men.

1059
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,729
And of horses.

1060
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:35,689
Where?

1061
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:38,817
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1062
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:43,447
Spears rise...

1063
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:47,534
like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1064
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:50,954
The Dead are following.

1065
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,624
They have been summoned.

1066
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,126
The Dead?

1067
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,253
Summoned?

1068
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:00,547
I knew that.

1069
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,258
Huh. Ha.

1070
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,636
Very good.

1071
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:08,430
Very good! Legolas!

1072
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:47,803
Do not look down.

1073
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:45,527
Who enters my domain?

1074
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,491
One who will have your allegiance.

1075
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:59,750
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1076
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,753
You will suffer me.

1077
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:29,696
The way is shut.

1078
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:35,285
It was made by those who are dead.

1079
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:39,873
And the Dead keep it.

1080
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:52,094
The way is shut.

1081
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,473
Now you must die.

1082
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,146
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1083
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:08,485
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1084
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,243
That line was broken.

1085
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:21,081
It has been remade.

1086
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:30,507
Fight for us...

1087
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,260
and regain your honor.

1088
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:38,765
What say you?

1089
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:52,529
What say you?

1090
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:55,031
Ah! You waste your time, Aragorn.

1091
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:58,368
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1092
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,371
I am Isildur's heir.

1093
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,874
Fight for me...

1094
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:08,086
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1095
01:56:12,007 --> 01:56:13,967
What say you?

1096
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:24,102
You have my word!

1097
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:28,398
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1098
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:31,359
What say you?!

1099
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,616
Stand, you traitors!

1100
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:05,602
Out!

1101
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,542
Legolas!

1102
01:57:29,668 --> 01:57:30,877
Run!

1103
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:39,237
We fight.

1104
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:52,208
Open the gate! Quick!

1105
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:25,241
Quick! Hurry!

1106
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:40,590
Faramir!

1107
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:44,886
Say not that he has fallen.

1108
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:47,597
They were outnumbered.

1109
01:59:48,014 --> 01:59:49,599
None survived.

1110
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:52,310
Fear.

1111
01:59:52,852 --> 01:59:56,064
The city is rank with it.

1112
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,860
Let us ease their pain.

1113
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,862
Release the prisoners.

1114
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,948
Catapults!

1115
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:10,328
Shields up!

1116
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:21,798
My sons are spent.

1117
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,760
My line has ended.

1118
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:29,973
He's alive!

1119
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,309
The House of Stewards has failed.

1120
02:00:33,476 --> 02:00:34,978
He needs medicine, my lord.

1121
02:00:35,979 --> 02:00:38,648
My line has ended!

1122
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,152
My lord!

1123
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:51,244
Put it in!

1124
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:57,500
Rohan...

1125
02:00:58,293 --> 02:01:00,670
has deserted us.

1126
02:01:15,143 --> 02:01:18,354
Théoden's betrayed me.

1127
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,326
Abandon your posts!

1128
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:36,289
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1129
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,627
Oh!

1130
02:01:46,424 --> 02:01:47,967
Prepare for battle!

1131
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:51,679
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1132
02:01:52,847 --> 02:01:54,808
Over here!

1133
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,936
Return to your posts!

1134
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:11,366
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1135
02:02:21,543 --> 02:02:23,002
Stay where you are.

1136
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:41,396
We need more rubble!

1137
02:02:41,563 --> 02:02:43,439
Watch out!

1138
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:46,109
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1139
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:49,571
Double up, men!

1140
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,088
Yah!

1141
02:03:58,556 --> 02:04:01,559
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1142
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,563
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1143
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:47,855
Not at the towers!

1144
02:04:48,022 --> 02:04:51,025
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1145
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:53,611
Bring them down!

1146
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:30,773
Fight them back!

1147
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,942
Peregrin Took!

1148
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:36,946
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1149
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:55,048
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1150
02:06:20,782 --> 02:06:22,241
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1151
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:26,204
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1152
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,510
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1153
02:06:40,676 --> 02:06:42,637
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1154
02:06:48,976 --> 02:06:51,354
Get back there and smash it down.

1155
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,523
But nothing can breach it.

1156
02:06:56,484 --> 02:06:58,736
Grond will breach it.

1157
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,242
Bring up the wolf's head.

1158
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:12,750
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1159
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:16,879
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1160
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,260
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1161
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:26,639
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1162
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:31,227
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1163
02:07:31,394 --> 02:07:35,022
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1164
02:07:56,272 --> 02:07:58,065
You may go no further.

1165
02:08:01,277 --> 02:08:03,446
You will not enter Gondor.

1166
02:08:05,031 --> 02:08:06,991
Who are you to deny us passage?

1167
02:08:07,074 --> 02:08:10,912
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1168
02:08:13,122 --> 02:08:14,749
Mind your aim.

1169
02:08:19,587 --> 02:08:21,380
Oh!

1170
02:08:21,464 --> 02:08:23,966
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1171
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,802
Prepare to be boarded.

1172
02:08:27,553 --> 02:08:28,971
Boarded?

1173
02:08:29,055 --> 02:08:30,765
By you and whose army?

1174
02:08:32,308 --> 02:08:34,602
This army.

1175
02:08:51,285 --> 02:08:53,120
In there.

1176
02:08:54,789 --> 02:08:56,666
What is this place?

1177
02:09:01,045 --> 02:09:04,465
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1178
02:09:05,842 --> 02:09:09,846
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1179
02:09:11,931 --> 02:09:14,183
It's the only way.

1180
02:09:16,519 --> 02:09:18,521
Go in...

1181
02:09:19,063 --> 02:09:21,315
or go back.

1182
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:26,737
I can't go back.

1183
02:09:38,958 --> 02:09:41,711
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1184
02:09:41,794 --> 02:09:45,047
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1185
02:09:50,052 --> 02:09:51,888
Hurry.

1186
02:09:56,767 --> 02:09:58,728
This way.

1187
02:10:01,564 --> 02:10:03,399
Sméagol?

1188
02:10:04,358 --> 02:10:06,527
Over here.

1189
02:10:11,365 --> 02:10:12,742
Oh!

1190
02:10:12,825 --> 02:10:14,660
Aah! Aah!

1191
02:10:14,744 --> 02:10:17,997
It's sticky. What is it?

1192
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:20,458
You'll see.

1193
02:10:20,541 --> 02:10:22,960
Oh, yes.

1194
02:10:23,044 --> 02:10:26,255
You will see.

1195
02:10:35,139 --> 02:10:36,807
Sméagol?

1196
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,435
Sméagol!

1197
02:10:42,104 --> 02:10:44,065
Sméagol!

1198
02:10:53,282 --> 02:10:55,284
Sam.

1199
02:12:35,342 --> 02:12:37,511
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1200
02:12:37,595 --> 02:12:43,017
I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

1201
02:12:43,768 --> 02:12:47,104
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1202
02:12:47,188 --> 02:12:50,775
when all other lights go out.

1203
02:14:07,143 --> 02:14:10,479
Naughty little fly.

1204
02:14:10,563 --> 02:14:13,816
Why does he cry?

1205
02:14:14,316 --> 02:14:17,695
Caught in a web.

1206
02:14:17,778 --> 02:14:20,614
Soon you'll be...

1207
02:14:20,990 --> 02:14:22,825
Eaten.

1208
02:14:59,987 --> 02:15:02,740
Got away, did it, precious?

1209
02:15:02,823 --> 02:15:05,034
Not this time.

1210
02:15:05,117 --> 02:15:08,204
- Not this time!
- No!

1211
02:15:15,044 --> 02:15:18,380
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1212
02:15:18,881 --> 02:15:21,550
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1213
02:15:21,634 --> 02:15:23,594
We promised.

1214
02:15:23,677 --> 02:15:26,263
You must believe us.

1215
02:15:26,347 --> 02:15:28,182
It was the precious.

1216
02:15:28,265 --> 02:15:33,062
The precious made us do it.

1217
02:15:50,204 --> 02:15:53,082
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1218
02:16:02,091 --> 02:16:05,427
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1219
02:16:15,604 --> 02:16:16,939
No!

1220
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:42,631
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1221
02:16:47,094 --> 02:16:49,638
I'm so sorry.

1222
02:17:15,414 --> 02:17:20,210
This task was appointed
to you, Frodo of the Shire.

1223
02:17:21,337 --> 02:17:23,797
If you do not find a way...

1224
02:17:25,007 --> 02:17:26,300
ho one will.

1225
02:18:00,084 --> 02:18:02,920
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1226
02:18:03,003 --> 02:18:05,339
The lower level's in flames.

1227
02:18:05,756 --> 02:18:08,258
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1228
02:18:08,342 --> 02:18:09,593
Time is against us.

1229
02:18:10,219 --> 02:18:11,595
Make ready!

1230
02:18:11,678 --> 02:18:13,597
Take heart, Merry.

1231
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:15,891
It will soon be over.

1232
02:18:16,517 --> 02:18:18,060
My lady...

1233
02:18:18,685 --> 02:18:21,230
you are fair and brave...

1234
02:18:21,563 --> 02:18:24,024
and have much to live for...

1235
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,736
and many who love you.

1236
02:18:30,531 --> 02:18:33,242
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1237
02:18:33,784 --> 02:18:37,037
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1238
02:18:38,247 --> 02:18:41,667
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1239
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:44,962
But I'm not.

1240
02:18:45,045 --> 02:18:46,922
I'm a Hobbit.

1241
02:18:49,633 --> 02:18:52,136
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1242
02:18:55,556 --> 02:18:57,891
I just want to help my friends.

1243
02:18:59,935 --> 02:19:01,437
Frodo.

1244
02:19:02,271 --> 02:19:04,064
Sam.

1245
02:19:05,607 --> 02:19:07,651
Pippin.

1246
02:19:09,111 --> 02:19:12,156
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1247
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:18,787
Prepare to move out!

1248
02:19:18,871 --> 02:19:21,665
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1249
02:19:38,307 --> 02:19:39,641
To battle.

1250
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:41,518
To battle.

1251
02:20:04,625 --> 02:20:06,376
Back to the gate!

1252
02:20:06,668 --> 02:20:08,837
Hurry!

1253
02:20:28,732 --> 02:20:33,278
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1254
02:20:33,362 --> 02:20:35,822
Thus have I walked.

1255
02:20:37,032 --> 02:20:40,118
And thus now will I sleep.

1256
02:20:46,166 --> 02:20:48,252
Gondor is lost.

1257
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:52,214
There is no hope for Men.

1258
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:09,648
Why do the fools fly?

1259
02:21:11,191 --> 02:21:14,236
Better to die sooner than late.

1260
02:21:16,405 --> 02:21:18,448
For die we must.

1261
02:21:30,586 --> 02:21:33,672
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1262
02:21:34,756 --> 02:21:40,804
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1263
02:21:40,887 --> 02:21:46,101
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1264
02:21:49,771 --> 02:21:51,565
Bring wood and oil.

1265
02:21:54,401 --> 02:21:55,819
Steady.

1266
02:21:55,902 --> 02:21:57,988
Steady.

1267
02:22:12,419 --> 02:22:14,963
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1268
02:22:15,213 --> 02:22:19,635
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1269
02:22:26,141 --> 02:22:27,309
Run!

1270
02:22:29,227 --> 02:22:30,729
Volley!

1271
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:33,398
Fire!

1272
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:28,555
Let him go, you filth.

1273
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:32,100
Let him go!

1274
02:24:33,393 --> 02:24:35,562
You will not touch him again.

1275
02:24:38,648 --> 02:24:40,567
Come on and finish it.

1276
02:26:29,551 --> 02:26:31,887
Ha! Back!

1277
02:26:42,731 --> 02:26:44,024
Mr. Frodo.

1278
02:26:53,575 --> 02:26:55,619
Oh, no.

1279
02:26:55,702 --> 02:26:57,704
Frodo.

1280
02:26:57,996 --> 02:26:59,873
Mr. Frodo.

1281
02:27:04,419 --> 02:27:05,754
Wake up.

1282
02:27:09,591 --> 02:27:12,010
Don't leave me here alone.

1283
02:27:13,511 --> 02:27:15,931
Don't go where I can't follow.

1284
02:27:20,268 --> 02:27:21,603
Wake up.

1285
02:27:28,276 --> 02:27:30,528
Not asleep.

1286
02:27:32,614 --> 02:27:34,574
Dead.

1287
02:27:53,259 --> 02:27:54,803
You get back, you scum!

1288
02:28:04,437 --> 02:28:05,772
What's this?

1289
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:09,651
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1290
02:28:11,653 --> 02:28:14,239
Killed another one, has she?

1291
02:28:14,322 --> 02:28:16,324
No.

1292
02:28:19,077 --> 02:28:21,079
This fellow ain't dead.

1293
02:28:21,371 --> 02:28:23,707
Not dead?

1294
02:28:23,790 --> 02:28:29,671
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1295
02:28:30,005 --> 02:28:32,716
Then she has her way with them.

1296
02:28:33,091 --> 02:28:34,801
That's how she likes to feed.

1297
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:37,470
Fresh blood.

1298
02:28:37,554 --> 02:28:39,889
Get him to the tower!

1299
02:28:43,351 --> 02:28:45,103
Samwise, you fool.

1300
02:28:45,186 --> 02:28:48,106
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1301
02:28:48,189 --> 02:28:50,734
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1302
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:18,261
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1303
02:29:19,345 --> 02:29:20,764
He is burning.

1304
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:23,224
Already burning.

1305
02:29:23,641 --> 02:29:25,643
He's not dead.

1306
02:29:26,061 --> 02:29:27,729
He's not dead!

1307
02:29:29,939 --> 02:29:31,775
No! No!

1308
02:29:31,858 --> 02:29:34,277
No! No!

1309
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:36,404
He's not dead!

1310
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:40,283
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1311
02:29:40,366 --> 02:29:43,745
I release you from my service.

1312
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:49,417
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1313
02:29:51,586 --> 02:29:53,922
Pour oil on the wood!

1314
02:29:55,673 --> 02:29:57,717
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1315
02:29:58,218 --> 02:30:01,096
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1316
02:30:01,471 --> 02:30:02,931
Where is Gandalf?

1317
02:30:04,099 --> 02:30:05,350
Gandalf!

1318
02:30:10,772 --> 02:30:11,940
Retreat!

1319
02:30:14,109 --> 02:30:15,944
The city is breached!

1320
02:30:16,027 --> 02:30:18,988
Fall back to the second level!

1321
02:30:22,784 --> 02:30:24,410
Get the women and children out!

1322
02:30:24,786 --> 02:30:26,579
Get them out!

1323
02:30:26,663 --> 02:30:28,206
Retreat!

1324
02:30:28,289 --> 02:30:30,125
Come on. Come on.

1325
02:30:30,458 --> 02:30:34,754
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1326
02:30:42,762 --> 02:30:45,140
Take them down!

1327
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:08,621
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1328
02:31:08,705 --> 02:31:10,039
Fight for your lives!

1329
02:31:10,123 --> 02:31:11,457
Gandalf!

1330
02:31:15,837 --> 02:31:17,213
Gandalf!

1331
02:31:17,297 --> 02:31:20,008
Denethor has lost his mind!

1332
02:31:20,091 --> 02:31:22,427
He's burning Faramir alive!

1333
02:31:22,510 --> 02:31:24,345
Up! Quickly!

1334
02:31:31,186 --> 02:31:32,687
Go back to the abyss.

1335
02:31:34,189 --> 02:31:37,400
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1336
02:31:37,483 --> 02:31:44,073
Do you not know death
when you see it, old man?

1337
02:31:44,157 --> 02:31:48,953
This is my hour.

1338
02:31:58,421 --> 02:32:00,048
Gandalf!

1339
02:32:08,890 --> 02:32:12,435
You have failed.

1340
02:32:13,228 --> 02:32:18,066
The world of Men will fall.

1341
02:33:15,373 --> 02:33:16,833
Courage, Merry.

1342
02:33:16,916 --> 02:33:19,377
Courage for our friends.

1343
02:33:22,922 --> 02:33:26,009
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1344
02:33:26,092 --> 02:33:29,429
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1345
02:33:37,478 --> 02:33:40,690
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1346
02:33:40,773 --> 02:33:42,150
Flank ready.

1347
02:33:42,233 --> 02:33:45,194
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

1348
02:33:45,278 --> 02:33:49,032
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1349
02:33:49,115 --> 02:33:51,993
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1350
02:33:52,076 --> 02:33:56,039
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1351
02:33:56,122 --> 02:34:01,419
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1352
02:34:01,502 --> 02:34:05,340
a sword-day, a red day...

1353
02:34:05,423 --> 02:34:09,010
ere the sun rises!

1354
02:34:16,809 --> 02:34:21,147
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1355
02:34:27,487 --> 02:34:29,530
Ride now!

1356
02:34:30,990 --> 02:34:33,159
Ride now!

1357
02:34:33,701 --> 02:34:36,537
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1358
02:34:36,621 --> 02:34:39,457
and the world's ending!

1359
02:34:41,334 --> 02:34:42,794
Death!

1360
02:34:43,169 --> 02:34:46,172
Death!

1361
02:34:46,255 --> 02:34:49,509
- Death!
- Death!

1362
02:34:49,967 --> 02:34:51,511
- Death!
- Death!

1363
02:34:52,220 --> 02:34:55,681
- Death!
- Death!

1364
02:35:00,812 --> 02:35:03,189
Forth Eorlingas!

1365
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:47,900
Fire!

1366
02:35:51,737 --> 02:35:52,905
Death!

1367
02:35:57,118 --> 02:35:58,411
Charge!

1368
02:35:58,911 --> 02:36:00,496
Fire at will!

1369
02:36:57,803 --> 02:37:01,140
Set a fire in our flesh.

1370
02:37:18,783 --> 02:37:20,493
Stay this madness!

1371
02:37:24,830 --> 02:37:29,460
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1372
02:37:30,002 --> 02:37:33,673
but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1373
02:37:33,756 --> 02:37:37,009
there is no victory.

1374
02:38:06,205 --> 02:38:08,040
No!

1375
02:38:08,124 --> 02:38:10,876
You will not take my son from me!

1376
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:13,421
No! No!

1377
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,880
Yah!

1378
02:38:24,223 --> 02:38:25,891
Faramir.

1379
02:38:39,447 --> 02:38:43,409
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1380
02:39:10,936 --> 02:39:12,772
Drive them to the river!

1381
02:39:15,483 --> 02:39:17,485
Make safe the city!

1382
02:39:57,483 --> 02:39:59,485
Re-form the line!

1383
02:40:00,611 --> 02:40:02,530
Re-form the line!

1384
02:40:09,537 --> 02:40:12,164
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1385
02:40:12,832 --> 02:40:15,000
Charge!

1386
02:41:33,913 --> 02:41:35,331
Cut him down!

1387
02:41:37,082 --> 02:41:39,043
Follow me!

1388
02:42:01,982 --> 02:42:04,610
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1389
02:42:06,987 --> 02:42:08,280
Left!

1390
02:42:25,673 --> 02:42:27,383
Aim for their heads!

1391
02:42:33,389 --> 02:42:36,642
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1392
02:42:50,489 --> 02:42:51,991
Merry!

1393
02:44:05,397 --> 02:44:07,483
I didn't think it would end this way.

1394
02:44:08,734 --> 02:44:10,194
End?

1395
02:44:11,403 --> 02:44:13,572
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1396
02:44:16,075 --> 02:44:19,203
Death is just another path...

1397
02:44:19,745 --> 02:44:21,413
one that we all must take.

1398
02:44:22,706 --> 02:44:26,168
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1399
02:44:26,251 --> 02:44:29,922
and all turns to silver glass.

1400
02:44:32,091 --> 02:44:34,093
And then you see it.

1401
02:44:36,011 --> 02:44:38,389
What, Gandalf?

1402
02:44:39,515 --> 02:44:40,808
See what?

1403
02:44:42,101 --> 02:44:44,269
White shores...

1404
02:44:45,938 --> 02:44:48,399
and beyond.

1405
02:44:49,817 --> 02:44:51,610
A far green country...

1406
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:55,280
under a swift sunrise.

1407
02:44:59,284 --> 02:45:00,828
Well...

1408
02:45:00,911 --> 02:45:02,663
that isn't so bad.

1409
02:45:02,746 --> 02:45:04,248
No.

1410
02:45:06,291 --> 02:45:07,960
No, it isn't.

1411
02:45:24,309 --> 02:45:27,688
Rally to me! To me!

1412
02:45:48,459 --> 02:45:53,005
Feast on his flesh.

1413
02:45:57,342 --> 02:45:59,720
I will kill you if you touch him.

1414
02:45:59,803 --> 02:46:05,350
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1415
02:47:13,752 --> 02:47:16,922
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1416
02:47:17,381 --> 02:47:19,633
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1417
02:47:19,716 --> 02:47:22,970
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1418
02:47:38,443 --> 02:47:40,654
There's plenty for the both of us.

1419
02:47:40,737 --> 02:47:42,823
May the best Dwarf win.

1420
02:48:00,299 --> 02:48:02,593
You fool.

1421
02:48:02,676 --> 02:48:06,138
No man can kill me.

1422
02:48:08,473 --> 02:48:11,643
Die now.

1423
02:48:22,321 --> 02:48:24,364
I am no man.

1424
02:48:40,881 --> 02:48:44,384
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

1425
02:48:52,184 --> 02:48:54,061
Merry!

1426
02:49:36,061 --> 02:49:37,896
Legolas!

1427
02:50:00,252 --> 02:50:02,629
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1428
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:52,179
That still only counts as one!

1429
02:50:52,262 --> 02:50:54,473
Come on, then. Come on!

1430
02:51:38,183 --> 02:51:41,019
I know your face...

1431
02:51:42,854 --> 02:51:44,689
Éowyn.

1432
02:51:47,317 --> 02:51:49,694
My eyes darken.

1433
02:51:50,821 --> 02:51:52,197
No.

1434
02:51:53,031 --> 02:51:54,658
No.

1435
02:51:56,701 --> 02:51:59,204
I am going to save you.

1436
02:52:00,539 --> 02:52:02,874
You already did.

1437
02:52:06,545 --> 02:52:08,213
Éowyn...

1438
02:52:09,714 --> 02:52:12,217
my body is broken.

1439
02:52:17,222 --> 02:52:19,724
You have to let me go.

1440
02:52:25,564 --> 02:52:28,191
I go to my fathers...

1441
02:52:29,609 --> 02:52:32,487
in whose mighty company...

1442
02:52:32,904 --> 02:52:36,241
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1443
02:52:52,883 --> 02:52:54,509
Éowyn.

1444
02:53:40,972 --> 02:53:43,475
Release us.

1445
02:53:45,352 --> 02:53:47,145
Bad idea.

1446
02:53:47,229 --> 02:53:51,149
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1447
02:53:51,233 --> 02:53:53,276
You gave us your word.

1448
02:53:54,986 --> 02:53:57,155
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1449
02:53:58,490 --> 02:53:59,824
Go.

1450
02:54:00,659 --> 02:54:02,327
Be at peace.

1451
02:54:45,704 --> 02:54:47,622
Merry.

1452
02:54:48,206 --> 02:54:51,376
No!

1453
02:54:55,338 --> 02:54:57,716
No!

1454
02:56:44,823 --> 02:56:46,032
Merry!

1455
02:56:47,659 --> 02:56:49,661
Merry!

1456
02:57:01,005 --> 02:57:02,841
Merry.

1457
02:57:05,343 --> 02:57:06,553
Merry, it's me.

1458
02:57:09,180 --> 02:57:10,765
It's Pippin.

1459
02:57:13,268 --> 02:57:15,562
I knew you'd find me.

1460
02:57:15,645 --> 02:57:16,896
Yes.

1461
02:57:19,357 --> 02:57:21,401
Are you going to leave me?

1462
02:57:21,985 --> 02:57:23,695
No, Merry.

1463
02:57:24,988 --> 02:57:27,198
I'm going to look after you.

1464
02:58:11,201 --> 02:58:12,702
Hands off!

1465
02:58:12,786 --> 02:58:15,955
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1466
02:58:16,247 --> 02:58:20,418
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1467
02:58:21,920 --> 02:58:25,757
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1468
02:58:26,591 --> 02:58:31,846
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1469
02:58:52,450 --> 02:58:54,327
The scum tried to knife me.

1470
02:58:54,410 --> 02:58:56,162
Kill him!

1471
03:00:39,390 --> 03:00:41,392
That's for Frodo!

1472
03:00:41,768 --> 03:00:43,895
And for the Shire!

1473
03:00:47,523 --> 03:00:49,609
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1474
03:01:19,097 --> 03:01:22,433
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1475
03:01:23,601 --> 03:01:28,272
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1476
03:01:35,613 --> 03:01:38,324
- Not if I stick you first.
- Sam!

1477
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:46,165
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1478
03:01:46,249 --> 03:01:48,292
Sorry for everything.

1479
03:01:48,793 --> 03:01:52,505
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1480
03:01:52,588 --> 03:01:55,550
They've taken it. Sam...

1481
03:01:56,300 --> 03:01:57,802
they took the Ring.

1482
03:01:58,594 --> 03:02:01,305
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1483
03:02:13,276 --> 03:02:15,486
I thought I'd lost you.

1484
03:02:15,820 --> 03:02:17,572
So I took it.

1485
03:02:18,698 --> 03:02:20,825
Only for safekeeping.

1486
03:02:22,076 --> 03:02:23,828
Give it to me.

1487
03:02:27,331 --> 03:02:29,584
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1488
03:02:34,213 --> 03:02:35,506
Sam.

1489
03:02:37,091 --> 03:02:39,010
Give me the Ring.

1490
03:02:59,739 --> 03:03:01,741
You must understand.

1491
03:03:04,535 --> 03:03:06,370
The Ring is my burden.

1492
03:03:07,538 --> 03:03:09,707
It will destroy you, Sam.

1493
03:03:12,877 --> 03:03:14,879
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1494
03:03:16,214 --> 03:03:17,882
We best find you some clothes.

1495
03:03:17,965 --> 03:03:21,052
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1496
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:44,951
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1497
03:03:45,451 --> 03:03:47,745
We made it to Mordor.

1498
03:03:49,080 --> 03:03:50,748
There are so many of them.

1499
03:03:51,749 --> 03:03:54,293
We'll never get through unseen.

1500
03:03:59,423 --> 03:04:02,760
It's him, the Eye.

1501
03:04:10,476 --> 03:04:13,104
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1502
03:04:13,604 --> 03:04:15,606
There's nothing for it.

1503
03:04:18,609 --> 03:04:23,072
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1504
03:04:32,415 --> 03:04:35,626
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1505
03:04:36,961 --> 03:04:39,839
The darkness is deepening.

1506
03:04:39,922 --> 03:04:42,383
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1507
03:04:42,466 --> 03:04:44,594
It's only a matter of time.

1508
03:04:46,095 --> 03:04:48,472
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1509
03:04:49,515 --> 03:04:54,103
but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1510
03:04:54,187 --> 03:04:56,105
Let him stay there.

1511
03:04:56,189 --> 03:04:58,900
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1512
03:04:58,983 --> 03:05:04,238
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1513
03:05:10,995 --> 03:05:13,748
I've sent him to his death.

1514
03:05:15,249 --> 03:05:16,292
No.

1515
03:05:17,543 --> 03:05:19,253
There is still hope for Frodo.

1516
03:05:19,545 --> 03:05:23,674
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1517
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:27,345
- We can give him that.
- How?

1518
03:05:27,678 --> 03:05:30,431
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1519
03:05:30,514 --> 03:05:32,767
Empty his lands.

1520
03:05:32,850 --> 03:05:36,062
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1521
03:05:37,605 --> 03:05:39,941
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1522
03:05:40,024 --> 03:05:41,442
Not for ourselves.

1523
03:05:41,525 --> 03:05:47,198
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1524
03:05:48,991 --> 03:05:52,787
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1525
03:05:53,537 --> 03:05:54,747
A diversion.

1526
03:05:54,830 --> 03:05:56,749
Certainty of death...

1527
03:05:56,832 --> 03:05:59,585
small chance of success...

1528
03:06:00,503 --> 03:06:02,046
what are we waiting for?

1529
03:06:02,672 --> 03:06:05,049
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1530
03:06:05,883 --> 03:06:07,885
He will not take the bait.

1531
03:06:09,387 --> 03:06:11,889
Oh, I think he will.

1532
03:06:46,299 --> 03:06:48,926
Long have you hunted me.

1533
03:06:49,844 --> 03:06:51,095
Long have I eluded you.

1534
03:06:52,930 --> 03:06:54,557
No more.

1535
03:06:56,267 --> 03:06:58,644
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1536
03:07:43,147 --> 03:07:45,649
The city has fallen silent.

1537
03:07:47,318 --> 03:07:50,404
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1538
03:07:51,155 --> 03:07:52,907
It grows so cold.

1539
03:07:55,910 --> 03:07:58,954
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1540
03:08:05,336 --> 03:08:08,506
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1541
03:08:37,159 --> 03:08:38,702
Look, the Orcs...

1542
03:08:39,245 --> 03:08:41,247
they're moving off.

1543
03:08:42,331 --> 03:08:44,417
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1544
03:08:44,500 --> 03:08:46,919
some luck at last.

1545
03:08:47,002 --> 03:08:48,879
Move it, you slugs!

1546
03:08:50,214 --> 03:08:53,551
Come on! Faster!

1547
03:09:01,559 --> 03:09:04,895
Come along, you scum...

1548
03:09:04,979 --> 03:09:09,233
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1549
03:09:12,111 --> 03:09:13,779
Come on!

1550
03:09:13,863 --> 03:09:16,282
What have I told you?!

1551
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:24,582
Get up!

1552
03:09:24,999 --> 03:09:27,668
Come on, you slugs!

1553
03:09:27,751 --> 03:09:31,464
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1554
03:09:31,547 --> 03:09:36,552
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1555
03:09:49,523 --> 03:09:53,319
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1556
03:10:02,745 --> 03:10:06,290
Don't you know we're at war?

1557
03:10:28,646 --> 03:10:31,482
Company, halt!

1558
03:10:35,319 --> 03:10:38,739
Inspection!

1559
03:10:38,822 --> 03:10:41,367
Sam, help me.

1560
03:10:41,450 --> 03:10:43,327
Mr. Frodo!

1561
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:48,666
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1562
03:10:48,749 --> 03:10:50,626
It's so heavy.

1563
03:10:59,718 --> 03:11:00,886
Oh, no.

1564
03:11:06,517 --> 03:11:08,519
What do I do?
What do we do?

1565
03:11:11,397 --> 03:11:12,773
- Hit me.
- What?

1566
03:11:12,856 --> 03:11:15,025
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1567
03:11:15,109 --> 03:11:16,694
Get off of me!

1568
03:11:17,361 --> 03:11:19,697
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1569
03:11:28,372 --> 03:11:30,374
Get off of me!

1570
03:11:31,333 --> 03:11:33,210
Break it up! Break it up!

1571
03:11:35,754 --> 03:11:40,426
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1572
03:11:40,509 --> 03:11:42,886
Go, Sam. Now!

1573
03:11:51,770 --> 03:11:53,397
Move along, scum!

1574
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:55,399
Back in the line!

1575
03:11:55,899 --> 03:11:57,735
You maggots!

1576
03:11:58,402 --> 03:12:01,405
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1577
03:12:03,782 --> 03:12:07,244
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1578
03:12:09,955 --> 03:12:11,915
Move it!

1579
03:12:56,043 --> 03:12:58,170
I can't...

1580
03:12:58,253 --> 03:13:02,007
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1581
03:13:02,257 --> 03:13:03,384
It's... It's...

1582
03:13:03,467 --> 03:13:06,136
It's such a weight to carry.

1583
03:13:06,970 --> 03:13:08,097
It...

1584
03:13:08,180 --> 03:13:10,140
Such a weight.

1585
03:13:15,145 --> 03:13:17,606
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1586
03:13:19,024 --> 03:13:22,152
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1587
03:13:37,334 --> 03:13:39,169
Mr. Frodo.

1588
03:13:40,671 --> 03:13:42,172
Look.

1589
03:13:44,800 --> 03:13:46,635
There is light...

1590
03:13:46,969 --> 03:13:49,388
and beauty up there...

1591
03:13:49,471 --> 03:13:51,265
that no shadow can touch.

1592
03:14:42,316 --> 03:14:43,901
Take mine.

1593
03:14:44,401 --> 03:14:46,570
There's a few drops left.

1594
03:15:01,752 --> 03:15:04,379
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1595
03:15:05,255 --> 03:15:08,425
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1596
03:16:01,311 --> 03:16:03,480
Frodo, get down!

1597
03:16:05,274 --> 03:16:07,150
Hide!

1598
03:16:17,494 --> 03:16:19,329
Frodo!

1599
03:16:25,168 --> 03:16:26,628
Where are they?

1600
03:17:02,706 --> 03:17:05,709
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1601
03:17:06,668 --> 03:17:09,504
Let justice be done upon him!

1602
03:17:53,006 --> 03:17:56,927
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1603
03:18:02,766 --> 03:18:06,520
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1604
03:18:06,895 --> 03:18:10,023
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1605
03:18:10,107 --> 03:18:13,151
faithless and accursed.

1606
03:18:13,235 --> 03:18:16,780
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1607
03:18:16,863 --> 03:18:19,658
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1608
03:18:19,741 --> 03:18:23,120
Aha. Old Greybeard.

1609
03:18:24,579 --> 03:18:28,834
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1610
03:18:33,839 --> 03:18:35,173
Frodo.

1611
03:18:38,051 --> 03:18:39,469
Frodo.

1612
03:18:40,470 --> 03:18:41,680
- Silence.
- No!

1613
03:18:42,556 --> 03:18:43,849
Silence!

1614
03:18:45,642 --> 03:18:49,438
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1615
03:18:50,439 --> 03:18:54,526
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1616
03:18:59,990 --> 03:19:05,787
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1617
03:19:08,373 --> 03:19:10,542
And he did, Gandalf.

1618
03:19:10,625 --> 03:19:12,461
He did.

1619
03:19:19,468 --> 03:19:21,011
And who is this?

1620
03:19:21,094 --> 03:19:23,221
Isildur's heir?

1621
03:19:23,305 --> 03:19:26,349
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1622
03:19:31,146 --> 03:19:33,690
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1623
03:19:35,859 --> 03:19:37,027
I do not believe it.

1624
03:19:39,029 --> 03:19:40,322
I will not.

1625
03:19:56,546 --> 03:19:58,340
Pull back.

1626
03:19:58,632 --> 03:20:00,675
Pull back!

1627
03:20:12,896 --> 03:20:14,898
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1628
03:20:17,400 --> 03:20:20,445
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1629
03:20:20,529 --> 03:20:22,405
Something's drawn its gaze.

1630
03:20:39,923 --> 03:20:42,676
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1631
03:20:44,761 --> 03:20:48,765
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1632
03:20:51,601 --> 03:20:53,478
I see in your eyes...

1633
03:20:53,895 --> 03:20:57,941
the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1634
03:20:59,901 --> 03:21:03,822
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1635
03:21:03,905 --> 03:21:07,325
when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1636
03:21:07,409 --> 03:21:10,120
But it is not this day.

1637
03:21:10,412 --> 03:21:13,498
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1638
03:21:13,582 --> 03:21:16,501
when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1639
03:21:16,585 --> 03:21:19,171
But it is not this day.

1640
03:21:19,254 --> 03:21:20,964
This day we fight!

1641
03:21:23,425 --> 03:21:27,137
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1642
03:21:27,220 --> 03:21:31,474
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1643
03:22:59,938 --> 03:23:03,525
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1644
03:23:03,942 --> 03:23:06,319
What about side by side with a friend?

1645
03:23:09,864 --> 03:23:11,574
Aye.

1646
03:23:12,409 --> 03:23:14,202
I could do that.

1647
03:23:44,566 --> 03:23:46,609
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1648
03:23:49,612 --> 03:23:51,865
It'll be spring soon.

1649
03:23:52,615 --> 03:23:55,368
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1650
03:23:55,452 --> 03:23:59,164
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1651
03:24:00,582 --> 03:24:04,586
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1652
03:24:05,628 --> 03:24:09,966
and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1653
03:24:11,926 --> 03:24:14,429
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1654
03:24:15,972 --> 03:24:17,766
No, Sam.

1655
03:24:17,849 --> 03:24:20,810
I can't recall the taste of food...

1656
03:24:21,978 --> 03:24:25,315
nor the sound of water...

1657
03:24:25,398 --> 03:24:28,985
nor the touch of grass.

1658
03:24:29,986 --> 03:24:31,488
I'm...

1659
03:24:32,405 --> 03:24:33,782
naked in the dark.

1660
03:24:35,450 --> 03:24:37,786
There's... There's nothing.

1661
03:24:37,869 --> 03:24:42,624
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1662
03:24:43,833 --> 03:24:45,794
I can see him...

1663
03:24:46,169 --> 03:24:47,837
with my waking eyes.

1664
03:24:48,922 --> 03:24:51,341
Then let us be rid of it...

1665
03:24:51,966 --> 03:24:54,177
once and for all.

1666
03:24:54,928 --> 03:24:57,055
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1667
03:24:57,138 --> 03:24:59,808
I can't carry it for you...

1668
03:25:00,183 --> 03:25:02,227
but I can carry you.

1669
03:25:02,811 --> 03:25:04,521
Come on!

1670
03:25:34,968 --> 03:25:37,887
Aragorn.

1671
03:25:49,482 --> 03:25:52,068
Elessar.

1672
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:06,499
For Frodo.

1673
03:26:41,451 --> 03:26:42,952
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1674
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:45,830
A doorway.

1675
03:26:46,456 --> 03:26:48,124
We're almost there.

1676
03:26:50,460 --> 03:26:54,422
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1677
03:27:08,311 --> 03:27:09,979
Mustn't go that way.

1678
03:27:11,564 --> 03:27:14,025
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1679
03:27:14,108 --> 03:27:15,985
You swore!

1680
03:27:16,069 --> 03:27:18,154
You swore on the precious!

1681
03:27:20,073 --> 03:27:21,991
Sméagol promised!

1682
03:27:22,951 --> 03:27:24,953
Sméagol lied.

1683
03:28:17,422 --> 03:28:19,340
Frodo!

1684
03:28:46,409 --> 03:28:48,202
Eagles.

1685
03:28:49,579 --> 03:28:51,080
The eagles are coming!

1686
03:29:13,936 --> 03:29:15,772
Frodo!

1687
03:29:21,069 --> 03:29:22,320
I'm here, Sam.

1688
03:29:29,786 --> 03:29:31,454
Destroy it!

1689
03:29:41,964 --> 03:29:45,343
Go on! Now!

1690
03:29:45,426 --> 03:29:48,012
Throw it in the fire!

1691
03:30:01,359 --> 03:30:04,028
What are you waiting for?

1692
03:30:05,947 --> 03:30:08,324
Just let it go!

1693
03:30:41,524 --> 03:30:43,776
The Ring is mine.

1694
03:30:47,321 --> 03:30:49,031
No.

1695
03:30:49,490 --> 03:30:50,783
No.

1696
03:30:59,208 --> 03:31:01,878
No!

1697
03:32:46,274 --> 03:32:48,150
Yes!

1698
03:32:49,318 --> 03:32:51,028
Yes!

1699
03:32:52,154 --> 03:32:55,074
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:32:55,157 --> 03:32:58,077
Precious! Precious!

1701
03:33:51,339 --> 03:33:53,174
Give me your hand!

1702
03:34:01,515 --> 03:34:03,893
Take my hand!

1703
03:34:06,562 --> 03:34:07,897
No!

1704
03:34:15,196 --> 03:34:17,114
Don't you let go.

1705
03:34:21,744 --> 03:34:23,287
Don't let go.

1706
03:34:24,914 --> 03:34:26,415
Reach!

1707
03:35:55,588 --> 03:35:58,466
Frodo!

1708
03:35:59,008 --> 03:36:02,011
Frodo!

1709
03:37:23,425 --> 03:37:25,261
It's gone.

1710
03:37:29,723 --> 03:37:31,433
It's done.

1711
03:37:31,934 --> 03:37:33,936
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1712
03:37:35,312 --> 03:37:37,773
It's over now.

1713
03:38:03,424 --> 03:38:05,801
I can see the Shire.

1714
03:38:07,970 --> 03:38:10,306
The Brandywine River.

1715
03:38:12,474 --> 03:38:14,476
Bag End.

1716
03:38:16,812 --> 03:38:19,481
Gandalf's fireworks.

1717
03:38:19,940 --> 03:38:23,652
The lights in the Party Tree.

1718
03:38:25,154 --> 03:38:28,324
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1719
03:38:29,450 --> 03:38:32,161
She had ribbons in her hair.

1720
03:38:35,039 --> 03:38:38,000
If ever I was to marry someone...

1721
03:38:38,959 --> 03:38:41,170
it would've been her.

1722
03:38:42,630 --> 03:38:44,673
It would've been her.

1723
03:38:56,852 --> 03:39:00,022
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1724
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:07,279
here at the end of all things.

1725
03:40:56,972 --> 03:40:58,974
Gandalf?

1726
03:41:18,660 --> 03:41:20,662
Frodo!

1727
03:41:40,432 --> 03:41:42,226
Gimli!

1728
03:43:25,245 --> 03:43:28,957
Now come the days of the king.

1729
03:43:33,962 --> 03:43:36,298
May they be blessed.

1730
03:43:56,610 --> 03:43:59,321
This day does not belong to one man...

1731
03:43:59,404 --> 03:44:01,323
but to all.

1732
03:44:02,991 --> 03:44:05,953
Let us together rebuild this world...

1733
03:44:06,036 --> 03:44:10,332
that we may share
in the days of peace.

1734
03:46:44,820 --> 03:46:46,863
My friends...

1735
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:54,830
you bow to no one.

1736
03:47:39,040 --> 03:47:41,209
And thus it was.

1737
03:47:41,293 --> 03:47:44,963
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1738
03:47:45,046 --> 03:47:47,716
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1739
03:47:47,799 --> 03:47:52,387
though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1740
03:47:52,471 --> 03:47:54,890
was ended.

1741
03:47:59,895 --> 03:48:04,775
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1742
03:48:04,858 --> 03:48:09,070
we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1743
03:48:11,615 --> 03:48:14,367
We were home.

1744
03:48:20,916 --> 03:48:22,751
Hi.

1745
03:48:39,935 --> 03:48:42,145
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1746
03:48:49,861 --> 03:48:51,488
Hey!

1747
03:49:30,151 --> 03:49:31,862
More of the same, Rosie.

1748
03:49:31,945 --> 03:49:33,989
Good night, lads.

1749
03:50:18,533 --> 03:50:19,993
Hm?

1750
03:50:31,546 --> 03:50:35,550
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1751
03:50:36,885 --> 03:50:39,137
How do you go on...

1752
03:50:39,220 --> 03:50:44,517
when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1753
03:50:45,727 --> 03:50:48,730
there is no going back?

1754
03:50:49,397 --> 03:50:53,068
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1755
03:50:53,568 --> 03:50:56,529
some hurts that go too deep...

1756
03:50:58,239 --> 03:51:01,076
that have taken hold.

1757
03:51:39,280 --> 03:51:41,116
Mr. Frodo?

1758
03:51:44,452 --> 03:51:45,829
What is it?

1759
03:51:47,664 --> 03:51:51,626
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1760
03:51:52,293 --> 03:51:55,046
It's never really healed.

1761
03:51:58,967 --> 03:52:04,264
"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1762
03:52:04,973 --> 03:52:08,810
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1763
03:52:09,310 --> 03:52:11,479
You finished it.

1764
03:52:14,315 --> 03:52:15,817
Not quite.

1765
03:52:16,651 --> 03:52:19,154
There's room for a little more.

1766
03:52:21,823 --> 03:52:26,077
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1767
03:52:26,161 --> 03:52:29,497
that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1768
03:52:30,373 --> 03:52:33,209
Bilbo's story was now over.

1769
03:52:33,710 --> 03:52:36,713
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1770
03:52:36,796 --> 03:52:38,339
Save one.

1771
03:52:39,132 --> 03:52:42,719
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1772
03:52:42,802 --> 03:52:44,888
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1773
03:52:44,971 --> 03:52:47,766
The Elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1774
03:52:47,849 --> 03:52:50,518
a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1775
03:52:52,228 --> 03:52:53,897
Frodo...

1776
03:52:55,356 --> 03:52:59,861
any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1777
03:53:00,528 --> 03:53:02,739
The one I gave you.

1778
03:53:06,367 --> 03:53:08,536
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1779
03:53:11,122 --> 03:53:13,750
I'm afraid I lost it.

1780
03:53:13,833 --> 03:53:15,710
Oh.

1781
03:53:16,336 --> 03:53:17,754
Pity.

1782
03:53:20,548 --> 03:53:24,385
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1783
03:53:49,369 --> 03:53:51,037
Oh!

1784
03:53:53,581 --> 03:53:58,586
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1785
03:54:12,767 --> 03:54:16,104
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1786
03:54:16,938 --> 03:54:19,774
The time has come...

1787
03:54:19,858 --> 03:54:23,194
for the dominion of Men.

1788
03:54:35,582 --> 03:54:37,792
I think I'm...

1789
03:54:37,876 --> 03:54:42,297
quite ready
for another adventure.

1790
03:55:13,328 --> 03:55:15,705
Farewell...

1791
03:55:15,788 --> 03:55:18,541
my brave Hobbits.

1792
03:55:20,501 --> 03:55:22,503
My work is now finished.

1793
03:55:26,466 --> 03:55:31,346
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1794
03:55:32,013 --> 03:55:34,849
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1795
03:55:38,353 --> 03:55:40,855
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1796
03:55:41,522 --> 03:55:45,526
for not all tears are an evil.

1797
03:56:03,086 --> 03:56:05,046
It is time, Frodo.

1798
03:56:10,551 --> 03:56:12,553
What does he mean?

1799
03:56:15,056 --> 03:56:17,892
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1800
03:56:19,519 --> 03:56:22,230
And it has been saved.

1801
03:56:25,900 --> 03:56:28,569
But not for me.

1802
03:56:29,529 --> 03:56:31,948
You don't mean that.

1803
03:56:33,199 --> 03:56:35,243
You can't leave.

1804
03:56:43,751 --> 03:56:46,421
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1805
04:00:19,550 --> 04:00:22,428
My dear Sam:

1806
04:00:24,305 --> 04:00:27,683
You cannot always be torn in two.

1807
04:00:27,767 --> 04:00:31,979
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1808
04:00:32,688 --> 04:00:38,152
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1809
04:00:39,445 --> 04:00:42,615
Your part in the story will go on.

1810
04:00:43,324 --> 04:00:45,117
Well...

1811
04:00:46,994 --> 04:00:48,663
I'm back.

1812
04:02:31,223 --> 04:02:35,269
Lay down.

1813
04:02:36,896 --> 04:02:41,275
Your sweet and weary head.

1814
04:02:42,985 --> 04:02:46,614
Night is falling.

1815
04:02:47,281 --> 04:02:52,119
You have come
To journey's end.

1816
04:02:52,787 --> 04:02:56,582
Sleep now.

1817
04:02:56,666 --> 04:03:02,338
And dream
Of the ones who came before.

1818
04:03:04,131 --> 04:03:08,094
They are calling.

1819
04:03:08,177 --> 04:03:12,306
From across
The distant shore.

1820
04:03:13,933 --> 04:03:18,854
Why do you weep?

1821
04:03:18,938 --> 04:03:24,026
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1822
04:03:24,110 --> 04:03:29,240
Soon you will see.

1823
04:03:29,323 --> 04:03:34,370
All of your fears
Will pass away.

1824
04:03:34,453 --> 04:03:39,667
Safe in my arms.

1825
04:03:39,750 --> 04:03:44,338
You're only sleeping.

1826
04:03:44,422 --> 04:03:49,510
What can you see.

1827
04:03:49,593 --> 04:03:54,890
On the horizon?

1828
04:03:54,974 --> 04:03:59,562
Why do the white gulls.

1829
04:03:59,645 --> 04:04:04,400
Call?

1830
04:04:05,568 --> 04:04:10,239
Across the sea.

1831
04:04:10,322 --> 04:04:15,703
A pale moon rises.

1832
04:04:15,786 --> 04:04:18,581
The ships have come.

1833
04:04:18,664 --> 04:04:24,503
To carry you home.

1834
04:04:26,714 --> 04:04:31,302
And all will turn.

1835
04:04:31,385 --> 04:04:36,807
To silver glass.

1836
04:04:36,891 --> 04:04:41,270
A light on the water.

1837
04:04:41,353 --> 04:04:46,942
All souls pass.

1838
04:04:47,026 --> 04:04:51,238
Hope fades.

1839
04:04:52,823 --> 04:04:57,745
Into the world of night.

1840
04:04:58,412 --> 04:05:02,249
Through shadows falling.

1841
04:05:03,083 --> 04:05:08,255
Out of memory and time.

1842
04:05:08,923 --> 04:05:12,635
Don't say.

1843
04:05:13,427 --> 04:05:18,432
We have come now to the end.

1844
04:05:19,266 --> 04:05:23,771
White shores are calling.

1845
04:05:23,854 --> 04:05:27,483
You and I will meet again.

1846
04:05:27,566 --> 04:05:34,073
And you'll be here
In my arms.

1847
04:05:35,282 --> 04:05:39,370
Just sleeping.

1848
04:05:39,453 --> 04:05:44,375
What can you see.

1849
04:05:44,458 --> 04:05:49,505
On the horizon?

1850
04:05:49,588 --> 04:05:54,510
Why do the white gulls.

1851
04:05:54,593 --> 04:06:00,057
Call?

1852
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:05,354
Across the sea.

1853
04:06:05,437 --> 04:06:10,526
A pale moon rises.

1854
04:06:10,609 --> 04:06:13,487
The ships have come.

1855
04:06:13,571 --> 04:06:19,952
To carry you home.

1856
04:06:21,161 --> 04:06:26,292
And all will turn.

1857
04:06:26,834 --> 04:06:31,714
To silver glass.

1858
04:06:31,797 --> 04:06:36,051
A light on the water.

1859
04:06:36,135 --> 04:06:40,055
Grey ships pass.

1860
04:06:40,139 --> 04:06:45,853
Into the West
