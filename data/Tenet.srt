1
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:31,675
Hey!

2
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,948
We live in a twilight world.

3
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,660
We live in a twilight world.

4
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,662
And there are no friends at dusk.

5
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,749
You've been made. This siege
is a blind for them to vanish you.

6
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,672
But I established contact.

7
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,049
Bring you in or Kill you.

8
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,635
You have two minutes.
Make up your mind.

9
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,766
Where's the package?

10
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,101
Coat check.

11
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,667
Stay.

12
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,713
No friends at dusk, huh?

13
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,572
You'll do.

14
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,157
Get him to the rally point.

15
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,025
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

16
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,985
I've never seen encapsulation like this.

17
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,237
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

18
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,404
Did you have an out?

19
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,865
Service tunnel to the sewer.

20
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,619
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

21
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,620
Can you defuse that?

22
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,506
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

23
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,414
Covering their tracks.

24
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,225
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

25
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,560
That's not our mission.

26
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,668
Mine now.

27
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,153
Walk away.

28
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,117
You don't have to kill these people.

29
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:20,965
That wasn't one of us.

30
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,508
I'll take the help.

31
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,635
Go, go, go.

32
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,670
A man can be trained
to hold out for about 18 hours,

33
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,798
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

34
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,848
He didn't last 18 minutes.

35
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,766
He didn't have anything to hide.

36
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,227
You were smuggling a nobody.

37
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,940
It's risky.

38
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,529
Or were you counting on this?

39
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,905
Death.

40
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,991
CIA issue.

41
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,376
Spare yourself, once they clear.

42
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,517
Almost 7:00.

43
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,144
Uh-oh.

44
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,942
It's running fast.

45
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,199
We have to put it back one hour.

46
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,178
Get it out!

47
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,246
Welcome to the afterlife.

48
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,207
You've been in a medically-induced coma

49
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,919
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

50
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:08,132
The suicide pills are fake.

51
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,300
Why?

52
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,593
A test.

53
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,262
A test?

54
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,475
They pulled my teeth out.

55
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,229
Did my team get clear?

56
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,273
No.

57
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,567
Private Russians, we think.

58
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,486
Somebody talked.

59
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,655
Not you.

60
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,200
You chose to die
instead of giving up your colleagues.

61
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,087
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

62
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,301
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

63
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:53,677
You do.

64
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,518
I resign.

65
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,062
You don't work for us. You're dead.

66
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,108
Your duty transcends national interests.

67
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,027
This is about survival.

68
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,530
Whose?

69
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,451
Everyone's.

70
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,164
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

71
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,919
To even know its true nature is to lose.

72
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,545
This is knowledge divided.

73
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,341
All I have for you is a gesture

74
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,676
in combination with a word.

75
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,969
"Tenet."

76
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,097
Use it carefully.

77
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,894
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

78
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,979
That's all they've told you?

79
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,690
That test you passed?

80
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,610
Not everybody does.

81
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:09,164
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

82
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,958
Almost.

83
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,085
An obscure tenet.

84
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,844
No small talk.

85
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,138
Nothing that might reveal who we are
or what we do.

86
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,849
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

87
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,103
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

88
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,398
"What" is your department
and not my business.

89
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,191
Well, to do what I do...

90
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,236
I need some idea of the threat we face.

91
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,534
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War lll.

92
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,369
Nuclear holocaust?

93
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,954
No.

94
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,040
Something worse.

95
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,634
Aim it and pull the trigger.

96
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,721
It's empty.

97
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:06,888
Aim it.

98
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,937
Check the magazine.

99
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,526
How?

100
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,869
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

101
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,747
The other one's going backwards.

102
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,416
Can you tell which is which?

103
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,794
How about now?

104
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,006
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

105
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,176
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

106
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,471
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

107
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,637
You didn't make it?

108
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,973
No, we don't know how yet.

109
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,475
So, where'd it come from?

110
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,769
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

111
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,854
They're streaming back at us.

112
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,189
Try it.

113
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,198
You have to have dropped it.

114
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,170
How can it move before I touch it?

115
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,756
From your point of view, you caught it.

116
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,092
But from the bullet's point of view,
you dropped it.

117
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,010
But cause comes before effect.

118
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,554
No, that's just the way we see time.

119
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,890
Well, what about free will?

120
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,657
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

121
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,604
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

122
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,607
Don't try to understand it.

123
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,110
Feel it.

124
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,746
Instinct.

125
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,624
Got it.

126
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,464
Why does it feel so strange?

127
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,801
You're not shooting the bullet,

128
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,344
you're catching it.

129
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,556
Whoa.

130
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,102
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

131
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,269
In the field?

132
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,521
I was almost hit.

133
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,356
Then you were exceedingly lucky.

134
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,943
An inverted bullet passing
through your body would be devastating.

135
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,319
Not pretty.

136
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,114
These look like today's.

137
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,562
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

138
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,659
Where did you get them?

139
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,621
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

140
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,331
Do you have an analysis on the metals?

141
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,250
Sure. Why?

142
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,895
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

143
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,296
Look...

144
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,299
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

145
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,512
The bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.

146
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,515
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

147
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,434
If they can invert that,

148
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,811
I see no reason they couldn't invert
pretty much anything.

149
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,023
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

150
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,735
An inverted weapon might be able
to affect our past as well.

151
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,326
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

152
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,787
Remnants of complex objects.

153
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,584
What do you think we're seeing?

154
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,047
The detritus of a coming war.

155
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,211
- Yep?
- We live in a twilight world.

156
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,487
No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.

157
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,030
Even the dead need allies.

158
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,365
Specifically?

159
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,910
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

160
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,077
Singh?

161
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,961
He never leaves his house.
And his house is...

162
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,539
- his house.
- Yes, it is.

163
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,124
I'm looking right at it.

164
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,918
I'll see who's on deck.

165
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,087
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

166
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,752
It seems you need an introduction

167
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,979
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

168
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,231
I'm Neil.

169
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,400
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

170
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,861
That's not possible.

171
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,364
Ten minutes tops.

172
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,658
Time isn't the problem.

173
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,786
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

174
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:46,001
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

175
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,335
If I had to.

176
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,102
I'm not looking to make much noise here.

177
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,463
Yes?

178
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,508
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

179
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,970
What?

180
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,134
You never drink on the job.

181
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,765
You're well-informed.

182
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,477
Well, pays to be in our profession.

183
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,563
Well, I prefer soda water.

184
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,424
No, you don't.

185
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,403
How's your parachuting?

186
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,405
I broke an ankle during basic training.

187
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,366
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

188
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,868
It's bungee-jumpable.

189
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,537
I don't think "bungee-jumpable"
is a word.

190
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,498
It may not be a word, but it may be
our only way out of that place.

191
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,710
Or into it, for that matter.

192
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,919
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

193
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,941
Stay back.

194
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,445
I was almost taken out by a very unusual
type of ammunition in Ukraine.

195
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,489
I want to know who supplied it.

196
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,283
My name is Sanjay.

197
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,576
And you are?

198
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,454
No chitchat?

199
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,874
There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you, anyway.

200
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,377
Don't let it get cold.

201
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,381
Why should I know who supplied it?

202
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,468
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

203
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,778
If it's from India, it's from you.

204
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,471
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

205
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,055
Deduction, then.

206
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,807
Look, my friend...

207
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,852
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

208
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,521
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

209
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,256
Or the man they send to make deals.

210
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,777
But I am the man people talk to.

211
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,822
I can't.

212
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,199
I can't tell you.

213
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,426
You're an arms dealer, friend.

214
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,827
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

215
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,455
To say anything about a client

216
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,832
would violate the tenets he lives by.

217
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,669
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

218
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,546
Everything.

219
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,049
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

220
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,178
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

221
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,803
Cheers.

222
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,098
- Priya.
- Hmm.

223
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,184
This is your operation?

224
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,812
A masculine front in a man's world
has its uses.

225
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,898
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

226
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,441
The Russian oligarch.

227
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,235
- You know him?
- Not personally.

228
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,737
Made his billions in gas.

229
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:46,199
Moved to London.
Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

230
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,034
Very good.

231
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,787
Except the gas he made his billions from
was actually plutonium.

232
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:55,166
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

233
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,669
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

234
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,295
So how did he get them inverted?

235
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,091
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

236
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,260
Between our time and the future.

237
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,388
He can communicate with the future?

238
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,056
We all do, don't we?

239
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,141
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

240
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,228
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

241
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,482
The question is,
can the future speak back?

242
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,693
And I'm supposed to find out?

243
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,947
To get anywhere near Sator
would take a fresh-faced protagonist.

244
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,950
And you are fresh as a daisy.

245
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,410
Get close.

246
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,954
Find out what he's receiving and how.

247
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,998
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?

248
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,709
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

249
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,800
You must've had a plan for getting out.

250
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,511
Not one I love.

251
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,077
May I help you, sir?

252
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,871
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

253
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,790
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

254
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,042
Presume away.

255
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,668
If you'll follow me.

256
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,592
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

257
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,594
I'll catch up.

258
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,679
Same for me, please.

259
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,032
I'll send the waiter.

260
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,682
No, just pass on the order.

261
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,353
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

262
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,147
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

263
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,150
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

264
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,653
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

265
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,738
but they don't seem to care.

266
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,989
Tell me about him.

267
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,660
I assume you're familiar
with the Soviet-era secret cities.

268
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:58,247
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

269
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,501
Most of them have been opened up
and renamed as regular towns.

270
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,336
Not the one Sator grew up in.

271
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,587
Stalsk-12.

272
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,924
In the '70s, it had a population
of about 200,000.

273
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,133
Thought to be abandoned.

274
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,176
Abandoned?

275
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,722
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

276
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,475
Two weeks ago,
same day as the Kiev opera siege,

277
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,687
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

278
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,897
just where Stalsk-12 was.

279
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,526
Sator emerged
from this blank spot on the map

280
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,695
with ambition...

281
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,739
and enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

282
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:32,740
Through his wife?

283
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,952
Katherine Barton.
Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.

284
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,287
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

285
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,454
A happy marriage?

286
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,957
Practically estranged.

287
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,828
Well, how do I get to Sator?

288
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,252
Well, through her, of course.

289
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,921
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

290
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,589
Hardly.

291
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,676
We have an ace in the hole.

292
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,973
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag.

293
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,100
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.

294
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,812
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

295
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,427
What happened to the other one?

296
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:07,483
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

297
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,650
Put on auction.

298
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,653
And who do you think bought it?

299
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,821
Her husband?

300
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:12,947
Mmm-hmm.

301
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,159
Does she know it's a forgery?

302
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,535
Oh, it's hard to say.

303
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:21,581
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

304
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,874
Uh-huh.

305
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,085
Look, no offense,

306
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,672
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

307
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,384
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

308
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,094
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

309
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,680
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

310
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,141
Can I recommend a tailor?

311
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,434
I'll manage.

312
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,853
You British don't have a monopoly
on snobbery, you know.

313
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,271
Well, not a monopoly.

314
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,398
More of a controlling interest.

315
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,359
Could you box that up for me?

316
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,527
Certainly not.

317
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:54,739
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

318
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,815
How can I help, sir?

319
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,154
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

320
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,322
Goya.

321
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,491
Mr. Goya.

322
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,285
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

323
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,289
That's extraordinary.

324
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,879
What's it worth?

325
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,799
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

326
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,053
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

327
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,267
Provenance, microscopic examination,
X-rays.

328
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,519
But what does your heart tell you?

329
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,693
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

330
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,694
Tomas Arepo.

331
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,701
I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar
from an irate Swiss banker.

332
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,662
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

333
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,540
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

334
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,876
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

335
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,270
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

336
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,879
My drawing's a very good fake.

337
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,463
You know that better than anyone.

338
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,882
The information's the bargain.

339
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,094
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

340
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,264
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

341
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,867
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

342
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,183
Arrangement?

343
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,685
You mean blackmail.

344
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,145
Don't be afraid of the word.

345
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,314
My husband isn't.

346
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,149
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

347
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,196
He knows?
And he's never done anything about it?

348
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,444
Why would he?

349
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,112
He paid $9 million for it.

350
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,560
Barely cover the cost of the holiday
he just forced us on.

351
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,116
Where'd you go, Mars?

352
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,120
Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht.

353
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,832
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

354
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,350
Think you're a little out of your depth.

355
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,672
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

356
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,426
generally aren't okay with being
cheated out of any of it.

357
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,267
The drawing is his hold over me.

358
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:37,443
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

359
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,489
He controls me.

360
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,408
My contact with my son. Everything.

361
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,787
Leaving would never have been easy,
but now it's impossible.

362
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,082
You can't fight.

363
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,751
Just beg.

364
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,630
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.

365
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,425
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

366
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,680
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

367
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,099
imitating some earlier time
in our lives.

368
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,434
He seemed happy, so I asked him.

369
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,270
And he made me an offer.

370
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,023
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

371
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,989
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.

372
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,157
He called us, contrite.

373
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,034
And when we got back,

374
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,929
I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,

375
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,371
and he'd vanished.

376
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,292
I never felt such envy.

377
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,752
You don't seem the jealous type.

378
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,421
Of her freedom.

379
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,802
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

380
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,262
But you share a son.

381
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,848
That's my life now.

382
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,517
Did you know the drawing was a fake?

383
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
No.

384
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,146
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

385
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,313
I failed.

386
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,108
Andrei can't conceive of failure,
only betrayal.

387
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,943
But I didn't betray my husband.

388
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,529
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.

389
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,364
And he let Arepo walk free.

390
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,491
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

391
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,161
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

392
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,454
We spoke on the phone.

393
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,289
He can't do that either.

394
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,708
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

395
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,376
Get me an introduction.

396
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,253
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

397
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,672
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

398
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,675
I might just be your second chance.

399
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,594
No, I don't need redemption.

400
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,095
At betrayal.

401
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,225
Friends of your husband's?

402
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,855
You knew this was going to happen?

403
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,232
Don't worry, they won't kill you.

404
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,402
Andrei dislikes tangling with
local law enforcement on that level.

405
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,696
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

406
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:46,906
The look of you's fine.

407
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:50,367
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

408
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,763
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

409
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,080
Don't call from home.

410
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,416
You won't be taking my call.

411
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,212
I might surprise you.

412
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,120
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

413
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,541
Can we get going?

414
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,389
Please?

415
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,349
He wants you to see.

416
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,711
And he gets what he wants.

417
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,261
Not always, apparently.

418
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,079
Anna says we're going to Pompeii

419
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,020
and see lava.

420
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,522
We will. We'll go together.

421
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,316
I'll be there, too!

422
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,629
Told you I'd surprise you.

423
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,340
He's a cute kid.

424
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,549
He's everything.

425
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,637
Where's the drawing?

426
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,430
Oslo. At the airport.

427
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,805
The airport?

428
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,767
Do you know what a Freeport is?

429
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,288
A storage facility for art
that was acquired...

430
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,605
But not yet taxed.

431
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,274
We started a network.

432
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,195
Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.

433
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:33,239
The facilities are tax havens.

434
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,967
The clients can view their
investments without importing them,

435
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,993
so they avoid paying tax.

436
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,788
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

437
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,081
Art, antiquities.

438
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,368
- Anything of value, really.
- Anything?

439
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,126
Anything legal.

440
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,053
But it's not unlike the Swiss
banking system.

441
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,546
Opaque.

442
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,802
As I'm sure you are aware,
most Freeports are just warehouses.

443
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,638
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

444
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,158
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

445
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,184
And this way to the vaults!

446
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,103
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

447
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,438
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

448
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,283
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

449
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,235
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

450
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,153
But the Freeports are.

451
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,949
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

452
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,827
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

453
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,663
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

454
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:38,345
Some of our clients opt
for biometric access, straight in...

455
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,307
off the tarmac.

456
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,558
From the terminal?

457
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,477
From their private planes.

458
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,687
Of course.

459
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,441
Our logistics department
ships to and from

460
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,751
any other Freeport in the world

461
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,319
without customs inspection.

462
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,622
What are you hoping
to find in there?

463
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,864
You really wanna know?

464
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,741
I'm not sure.

465
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,826
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

466
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,202
Jesus.

467
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,954
It's nuclear.

468
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,123
When you're on the tour,

469
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,250
pay attention to the fire precautions.

470
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,021
Documents are vulnerable to...

471
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,379
Fire? Absolutely!

472
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,899
No, I was going to say water damage
from the sprinkler systems.

473
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,967
We don't use sprinklers.

474
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,762
The facility is flooded with halide gas,

475
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,889
displacing all the air within seconds.

476
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,224
Can you show me?

477
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,477
If I did, we'd suffocate.

478
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,854
What about the staff?

479
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,564
Halide only fills the vaults,

480
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,399
they just have to get
into either corridor,

481
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,443
and there is a ten-second warning.

482
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,153
At least you give them ten seconds.

483
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:41,283
Well, sir, our clients use us
because we have no priorities

484
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,743
above their property.

485
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:43,952
Blimey.

486
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,537
All doors are fireproof.

487
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,457
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

488
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,334
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

489
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,794
Why a lockdown?

490
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,713
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

491
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,466
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

492
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,718
And pickable locks.

493
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,154
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

494
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,179
Child's play?

495
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,639
They're inside airport security.

496
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,725
They have to worry about
climate control, not armed raids.

497
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,561
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

498
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,313
to trigger the lockdown procedure?

499
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:14,650
Back wall of the Freeport.

500
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:15,943
You've got something?

501
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,362
Not gonna like it.

502
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,989
You wanna crash a plane?

503
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,409
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

504
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,203
I want to run a jet off the taxiway

505
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,580
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

506
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,084
Well, how big a plane?

507
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,672
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

508
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,591
This is Mahir.

509
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,838
His team'II work the plane.

510
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,094
There can't be passengers.

511
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,804
Norsk Freight.

512
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,223
They use the hangar
on the west side of the Freeport.

513
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,630
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

514
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,269
We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.

515
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,687
On the move?

516
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,355
What's the problem? They'll be fine.

517
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,108
Well, it seems bold.

518
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,027
Bold I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say nuts.

519
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,255
And if you get caught?

520
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,279
We won't.

521
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,614
And if you do?

522
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,534
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

523
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,537
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

524
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,456
It'll barely make the news.

525
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,875
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

526
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,252
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

527
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,545
Gold bars?

528
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,797
Norsk Freight ships Treasury gold
once a month.

529
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,341
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

530
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,888
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

531
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,161
The space in the center
of the pentagon is too big.

532
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,436
There's something there.

533
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,397
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

534
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,609
That's 45 seconds.

535
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,860
Ample.

536
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,153
Won't you be running?

537
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,299
All right, it's your turn.

538
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,699
Start packing.

539
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,861
Gentlemen, if you would,
through the detector, please.

540
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,848
Sir?

541
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,183
Oh.

542
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
And, sir.

543
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,654
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

544
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,420
No, I'll take an espresso.

545
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,157
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

546
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,867
Excellent.

547
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,676
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

548
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,838
Because all I got here is vegetarian.

549
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,260
So that looks like meat,

550
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,988
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

551
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,181
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

552
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,015
Okay.

553
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,525
This way, gentlemen.

554
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,710
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

555
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,598
Carry on. Not the radio.

556
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,606
Let's go.

557
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,415
Uh...

558
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,012
Yoga.

559
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,977
Let's go! Now!

560
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,549
Go, go, go!

561
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,255
Right. Um...

562
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,524
You said ten seconds, right?

563
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,513
There's someone in here with us.

564
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,912
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

565
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,233
Don't touch them!

566
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,443
The hell happened here?

567
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,826
It hasn't happened yet.

568
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,258
Don't kill him!

569
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,386
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

570
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,557
Why are you here?

571
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,434
Who are you?

572
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,224
How'd you know we'd be here?

573
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,953
We need to go.

574
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,127
What happened to the other guy?

575
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,838
Took care of him.

576
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:17,998
Well, I've seen too much.

577
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,648
I'm still alive, which must mean
you've decided to trust me.

578
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,525
Or maybe I lost my edge.

579
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,277
Edge is still intact.

580
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,989
There's a cold war.

581
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,490
Nuclear?

582
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,076
Temporal.

583
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,453
Time travel?

584
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,537
No.

585
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,791
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

586
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,502
You mean reverse chronology.

587
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,147
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

588
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,255
moving backwards in time?

589
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,091
Sure, that's exactly what I meant.

590
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,675
I have a master's in physics.

591
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,177
Well, try and keep up.

592
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,804
The implications of this are...

593
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,970
Beyond secret.

594
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,177
Then why'd you bring me in?

595
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:56,142
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

596
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,936
Not as surprised as I was.

597
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

598
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,151
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

599
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,738
it's all about plutonium.

600
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,382
And when we're done, they'll kill you.

601
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,659
Won't you have to do that anyway?

602
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,953
I'd rather it be my decision.

603
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
So would I.

604
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,830
I think.

605
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:30,968
Your work?

606
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,181
What did you find in the vaults?

607
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,268
Two antagonists. One inverted.

608
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:42,147
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

609
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,648
Both emerged at the same moment?

610
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:44,816
Yeah.

611
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:46,651
They were the same person.

612
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,071
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.

613
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,447
Turnstile?

614
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,033
A machine for inverting.

615
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,828
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

616
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:57,995
It hasn't.

617
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,357
He's been given it by the future.

618
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,915
For what?

619
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,126
You have the best chance of finding out.

620
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,522
- Have you met him?
- I was close.

621
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,882
What if you have something he needs?

622
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,425
Such as?

623
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,719
Plutonium-241.

624
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:15,930
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241
from under a CIA team

625
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,474
at the opera siege in Kiev.

626
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,018
He got the team.

627
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:21,227
Not the 241.

628
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:22,228
Who did?

629
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,564
Ukrainian Security Services.

630
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,025
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

631
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,944
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

632
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,113
is unacceptable, Priya.

633
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,073
I'm just gonna take him out.

634
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,492
No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive.

635
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,287
He has to stay alive
until we know his part in things.

636
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,872
Leverage the situation,

637
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,041
without losing control of the 241.

638
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,667
It's too dangerous.

639
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,128
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can Kill billions,

640
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,923
is nothing compared with
what will happen if we don't stop Sator.

641
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,674
From doing what?

642
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:55,470
We are being attacked by the future.

643
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,766
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

644
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,076
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

645
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:19,911
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

646
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,704
You destroyed it?

647
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,082
I didn't think you'd want it back.

648
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,249
Does he know?

649
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,793
Not yet. So sit tight.

650
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,002
Sit tight?

651
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,898
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

652
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,006
It won't be long.

653
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,676
In the meantime, introduce me.

654
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,301
As what?

655
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:39,055
I'm a former first secretary
from the American Embassy in Riyadh.

656
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,974
We met at a party last June.

657
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,868
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

658
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,228
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

659
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:48,064
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

660
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:49,941
Sator left early. That's when we met.

661
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,526
I came into Shipley's in London.

662
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,194
You ran into me here

663
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,946
and wanna show me your yacht.

664
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,823
He'll think we're having an affair.

665
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:58,408
Then he'll wanna meet me.

666
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,574
Or have you killed.

667
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,828
Let me worry about that.

668
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,621
Did I look worried?

669
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,582
Sleeps 70 with crew.

670
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,252
Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

671
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,753
Afraid of pirates?

672
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,423
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

673
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,069
The day they turn, that's his refuge.

674
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,384
May I join you?

675
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,137
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers
just now.

676
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,972
Then we'll take mine.

677
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,923
Max!

678
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,635
Who's the American?

679
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,012
He's a friend.

680
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,349
The man from Shipley's.

681
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,685
Who you tried to have beaten up.

682
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,189
I ask again, who is he?

683
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,402
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

684
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,988
Good with fists for a diplomat.

685
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:21,157
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.

686
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:24,452
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

687
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,787
Max?

688
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,831
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

689
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,291
You just sent him off?

690
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,086
I promised him I'd go with him.

691
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,546
I explained you were busy.

692
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,425
With your friend.

693
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,031
Hey, easy, fella.

694
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,826
Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first.

695
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,839
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

696
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,717
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

697
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,970
Uh... No.

698
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:25,972
Not yet.

699
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,100
How would you like to die?

700
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:30,810
Old.

701
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,396
You chose the wrong profession.

702
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,108
There's a walled garden up the road.

703
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,527
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

704
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,613
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.

705
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,658
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

706
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,285
block the windpipe.

707
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:48,869
Complex.

708
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,831
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

709
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:55,835
try to pull his own balls
out of his throat before he chokes.

710
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,522
Is this how you treat all your guests?

711
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,088
We're finished.

712
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,135
Do you like opera?

713
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,101
Well?

714
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,478
Not here.

715
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:17,815
You sail?

716
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,192
I've messed around on boats.

717
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,278
Be on the dock at 8:00
ready to do more than mess around.

718
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,821
8:00 a.m.

719
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,713
Max has missed
too much school this year.

720
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,107
I'm taking him back to England.

721
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,901
The school won't be okay
with him missing so much of the term.

722
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,635
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

723
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,763
You have all the trappings of a king.

724
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,307
We both know you're a grubby little man
playing power games

725
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,267
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

726
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,937
You seem...

727
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:58,856
spirited today.

728
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:02,902
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

729
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,536
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

730
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,664
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

731
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:18,376
I've always had instincts
about the future.

732
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,172
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

733
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,022
Sailing or diving?

734
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,583
Rising!

735
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,443
What do you know about opera?

736
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,904
In 2008,
a remote Russian missile station

737
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,157
was overwhelmed and held for a week.

738
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,576
When the station was retaken,

739
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:37,413
241 on one warhead
was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

740
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,502
The missing 241

741
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:46,589
surfaced at the opera house siege
in Kiev on the 14th.

742
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:48,507
Coming about!

743
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,778
What do you propose?

744
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,738
Partnership.

745
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,782
I wouldn't partner with you.

746
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,951
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

747
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,330
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

748
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,998
who knows how to cover his tracks.

749
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,249
Not that shocking.

750
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,669
For an intelligence agent.

751
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,629
Right!

752
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:30,758
Burn in hell, Andrei.

753
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,017
You can't jibe a boat like this!

754
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,435
You can if you have to.

755
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,048
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

756
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,299
I need him.

757
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:13,968
What, to sell guns?

758
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:15,215
I'm not who you think I am.

759
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,387
Well, that I know.

760
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,222
He showed me the drawing.

761
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,684
I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.

762
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:23,731
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

763
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,313
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

764
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,481
He's so much more.

765
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,065
What, then?

766
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,737
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives
in his hands, not just yours.

767
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,580
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

768
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,747
Okay.

769
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,291
Now.

770
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,419
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?

771
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,218
- Trust me.
- Save it.

772
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,471
I'm not falling for it twice.

773
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,057
You have a better option?

774
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,937
Whatever it takes to get what you want.

775
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,607
Not a second's thought for me or my son.

776
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,363
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

777
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,376
Try not to use it.

778
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,047
On anyone.

779
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,762
Enough.

780
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:46,310
See? Pulse of a man half my age.

781
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,190
Drink with me.

782
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:55,027
It seems I now owe you my life.

783
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,612
It's nothing.

784
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,364
My life is not nothing.

785
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:01,158
And I don't like to be in debt.

786
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,327
Then pay me.

787
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,538
No retribution against your wife.

788
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,168
You think she released my harness?

789
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,423
It was my own mistake.

790
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:19,009
Then help me steal the 241.

791
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,428
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

792
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,490
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

793
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:24,932
I know what it means.

794
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:30,271
You lecture me about radiation?

795
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:33,190
Andrei Sator,

796
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:37,903
digging plutonium from the rubble
of my city as a teenager.

797
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,070
Where?

798
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,617
Stalsk-12.

799
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,120
My home.

800
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:53,460
One part of a warhead exploded
at ground level, scattering the others.

801
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,756
They needed people
to find the plutonium.

802
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:01,635
It became my first contract.

803
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,097
Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.

804
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,143
But...

805
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,731
one man's probability of death...

806
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:19,820
Is another man's possibility
for a life.

807
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:24,742
I staked my claim in the new Russia.

808
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:29,705
Even now, my company
is the only one to operate in the ruins.

809
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:33,709
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

810
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:37,963
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

811
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,467
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

812
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,515
Stay with us tonight.

813
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,309
I insist.

814
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:18,837
What do you want?

815
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,048
We're going to talk about today.

816
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,008
No, we're not.

817
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,176
No?

818
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,221
We'll see.

819
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,363
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

820
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,225
like you treat your other women.

821
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,229
And, uh...

822
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,315
how do you imagine...

823
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,734
I treat these other women, huh?

824
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,362
You think I force them
into conversation?

825
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:44,905
You wanna be quiet, fine.

826
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,699
You can bite down on that.

827
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:53,247
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

828
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,834
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?

829
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,241
That's all I have to offer you.

830
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,878
Well, that will have to do, then.

831
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,673
Why didn't you just let me go?

832
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,842
Because...

833
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:11,473
if I can't have you...

834
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,561
no one else can.

835
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,690
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

836
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,650
You think I let him interfere?

837
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,319
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.

838
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,529
End of deal.

839
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,491
So you leave me alone.

840
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,911
Not now!

841
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:56,972
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.

842
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,693
He was at the window.

843
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,696
I was curious.

844
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,950
My property shouldn't concern you.

845
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,702
Who are you?

846
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,954
How do you come by
your information about the opera?

847
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:25,375
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

848
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,837
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

849
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,381
They're usually buying, not selling.

850
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,885
But we do live in a twilight world.

851
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,845
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

852
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,722
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.

853
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,392
No balls in my throat?

854
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:46,063
There will be no time for such things...

855
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,231
in Tallinn.

856
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,568
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

857
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,778
No.

858
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,534
I spring the material. You pay me off.

859
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,286
Your wife does the exchange.

860
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,847
I never involve her in my business.

861
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,373
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

862
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,500
Put him ashore.

863
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,311
How do I contact you?

864
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,169
You don't.

865
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,004
How do you advance me the funds?

866
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:17,886
Handle the plutonium better than that.

867
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:29,207
What did you find on the gold?

868
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,233
No franks, no mold marks.
Nothing.

869
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,360
- How?
- Dead drops.

870
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,863
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

871
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:40,075
then digs it up to collect
the inverted materials they sent.

872
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,453
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

873
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,540
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

874
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:48,458
What did the soil samples show?

875
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:51,003
Northern Europe, Asia.

876
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,337
Radioactive.

877
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:55,382
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

878
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,258
Why am I here?

879
01:08:57,384 --> 01:09:00,595
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

880
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,868
Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?

881
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,810
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

882
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,062
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

883
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:10,856
They have a point.

884
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,042
Is the convoy monitored from the air?

885
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,737
Tracked by GPS.
One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.

886
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:18,185
We need big guns.

887
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,574
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

888
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,869
We need a fast car that
doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

889
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:25,245
All different.

890
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:28,290
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

891
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:32,127
Most of all, we have to set this up
with nothing in the record.

892
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,212
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

893
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:38,508
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

894
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,303
His ignorance is our only protection.

895
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,133
You see, Kat?

896
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:23,345
Some of my favorites.

897
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:29,726
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

898
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,396
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

899
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:36,024
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

900
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:39,319
But this is where our worlds collide.

901
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:41,071
What is this, Andrei?

902
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:44,241
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

903
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:48,412
The filthy business

904
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:52,416
that put those clothes on your back
and our boy in his school,

905
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,751
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

906
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,012
Time to go.

907
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,459
I'm not going anywhere with him.

908
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:08,681
Look at me!

909
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,436
And understand,

910
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,147
you don't negotiate with a tiger.

911
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:19,317
You admire a tiger until he turns on you

912
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:23,447
and you feel its true fucking nature!

913
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,449
Don't.

914
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,535
You stay right there.

915
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:34,499
Green. Two minutes.

916
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,433
You are not going to kill me.

917
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:01,318
I already tried.

918
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,527
You pushed me off a boat.

919
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,571
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

920
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,282
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

921
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:10,577
No, but you're not angry enough.

922
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,749
Because anger scars over into despair.

923
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,045
I look in your eyes...

924
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,173
I see despair.

925
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:30,222
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

926
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,890
Thinking that you're better!

927
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,141
Enough!

928
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,252
Tell me everything as it happens.

929
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:04,464
Seal me this side.

930
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,109
Yellow, 60 seconds.

931
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:25,819
60. Check.

932
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:43,003
Blue, 45 seconds.

933
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,005
Blue, 45, check.

934
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:03,940
Okay, Red. Coming to you.

935
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,875
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

936
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,463
All right, everyone set?

937
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,304
And five...

938
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,598
four...

939
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,557
three...

940
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:22,644
two...

941
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:25,814
one.

942
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:49,546
Go, Yellow!

943
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:54,634
We got a problem!

944
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:57,554
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

945
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,015
Check the radio chatter.

946
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,302
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

947
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:26,744
This is not one of them.

948
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,496
That's what he's after.

949
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,418
Can't understand this.

950
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:35,003
You said you spoke Estonian.

951
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,588
It's not Estonian.

952
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:37,839
It's backwards.

953
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:44,512
The hell is that?

954
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,154
Go, go, go!

955
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,202
Don't give it to him.

956
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:50,870
This isn't plutonium.

957
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,397
It's worse than that, God damn it!

958
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,100
Sorry.

959
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:29,242
He's getting away.

960
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:32,513
He left her in the car!

961
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:34,831
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

962
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:49,512
Pull up alongside!

963
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:07,613
Come on, come on. Closer!

964
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:12,994
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

965
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,706
Hurry up!

966
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,375
Please!

967
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,247
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

968
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,500
What cavalry?

969
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,941
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

970
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,088
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

971
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,072
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

972
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,177
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

973
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,536
is it really in the BMW?

974
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:20,787
I don't know.

975
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,290
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!

976
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,168
Leave her alone!

977
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,711
Kill him!

978
01:23:26,878 --> 01:23:28,713
I don't have time to negotiate.

979
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,571
- Listen to me!
- Three.

980
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:36,595
I can help you.

981
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:37,889
- Help me!
- Two.

982
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,055
Please!

983
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:40,224
- Don't!
- One.

984
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,287
Next one's a bullet to the head.

985
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,358
- No!
- One.

986
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,068
Two. Three.

987
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:52,403
Okay! Okay.

988
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,406
The car. The BMW.

989
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,407
I left it in the BMW.

990
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,010
We're going to check this is real.

991
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:01,787
It's in the glove box!

992
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,915
Where did you leave it?

993
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,877
Car or fire truck, which one?

994
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,480
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

995
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,504
I already told you.

996
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:13,715
I believe you.

997
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,385
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

998
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:29,941
Clear!

999
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,041
Wheeler, go check the other side.

1000
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:33,402
You two.

1001
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:34,654
Where did he go?

1002
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:35,738
The past.

1003
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:00,368
It's in the glove box!

1004
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:02,807
We're going to check this is real.

1005
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:08,479
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

1006
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:10,207
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1007
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,859
- No! No!
- One.

1008
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,528
- Listen to me.
- Two.

1009
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:16,821
Three.

1010
01:25:16,988 --> 01:25:18,668
I can help you.

1011
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,063
I don't have time to negotiate.

1012
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,177
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

1013
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,097
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

1014
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,289
is it really in the BMW?

1015
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:27,581
I don't know.

1016
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,750
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

1017
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:31,836
Who told you that?

1018
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,255
If you're not telling the truth,
she dies.

1019
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:36,502
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1020
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:50,001
- Medic!
- Check in.

1021
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:52,940
She's been shot?

1022
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:54,859
Bring her back, this side.

1023
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,029
Was she shot with an inverted round?

1024
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,494
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1025
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,956
"Us"! Who are these guys”?

1026
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:11,208
Priya's. Ours.

1027
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,877
How did Sator know about the ambush?

1028
01:26:13,044 --> 01:26:14,378
It's posterity.

1029
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:16,982
An ambush in the middle of the street
can't stay out of the records.

1030
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:19,967
Bullshit! He knew every move we made!
Every one of 'em.

1031
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:21,344
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1032
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,762
- Was it you?
- No. No.

1033
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:25,598
At every stage, you've known too much.

1034
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,476
I'm going to ask you again.

1035
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,395
Did you talk?

1036
01:26:33,064 --> 01:26:34,607
Nobody talked.

1037
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:37,068
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

1038
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:38,861
A what?

1039
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:42,573
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

1040
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,618
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

1041
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:48,746
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

1042
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,289
knowing everything.

1043
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:52,056
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

1044
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,335
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?

1045
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:55,854
I told you
it was what he was after.

1046
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,255
And you just told him where it was.

1047
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:00,549
I lied.

1048
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:04,512
Jesus. You lied about it?

1049
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,932
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

1050
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:11,310
Lying is standard operating procedure.

1051
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:12,645
It's spread too far.

1052
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:13,812
Meaning what?

1053
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,147
She's gonna die.

1054
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:16,857
Standard operating procedure.

1055
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:18,901
Can't you help her? Can we do something?

1056
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:21,737
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation
by inverting the patient?

1057
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:22,738
Takes days.

1058
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,073
Let's go.

1059
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,201
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

1060
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:29,412
How long is she gonna live on this side?

1061
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,080
Three hours, tops.

1062
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,748
I'm taking her through.

1063
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:35,000
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

1064
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,128
There's no way of bringing you back.

1065
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:38,879
We find another machine.

1066
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:40,464
A week ago? Where?

1067
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:44,051
Oslo.

1068
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:46,637
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

1069
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:47,930
It's impregnable.

1070
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,433
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

1071
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,101
We're going in.

1072
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:53,308
You might as well help us.

1073
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:55,980
This is a proving window.

1074
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,440
As you approach the turnstile,

1075
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,292
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

1076
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:00,359
do not enter the machine.

1077
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:01,360
Why not?

1078
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,338
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

1079
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:04,423
then you ain't getting out.

1080
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:06,449
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

1081
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:08,409
See for yourself.

1082
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:10,911
There's your answer. Let's go.

1083
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:36,955
She's stabilizing slowly.

1084
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,659
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

1085
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,107
How long does she need?

1086
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,568
Four, five days. A week to be sure.

1087
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,380
Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo.

1088
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:46,405
I'm going back out there.

1089
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:49,700
To do what?

1090
01:28:49,867 --> 01:28:52,547
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

1091
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,622
You didn't. You lied about where it was.

1092
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:55,789
Wait.

1093
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:57,791
You're going out there for her.

1094
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,478
He threatened to kill her in the past.

1095
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:01,107
If he does, what happens to her here?

1096
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,632
That's unknowable.

1097
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,027
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

1098
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:08,344
What do you believe?

1099
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:10,638
What's happened's happened.

1100
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:13,599
We need to save her, here and now.

1101
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:16,727
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

1102
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:19,271
Don't let them
take her back through there.

1103
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:20,481
Okay?

1104
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,149
We can't stay here.

1105
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,735
We don't have a lot of time.

1106
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:27,988
So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container

1107
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:30,241
that's just come off a ship from Oslo?

1108
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:31,825
This is cowboy shit.

1109
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,470
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into

1110
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:34,614
if you go through that door.

1111
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:36,622
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

1112
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:38,040
Wheeler, brief him.

1113
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:40,084
You'll need your own air.

1114
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:43,420
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

1115
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:44,713
Number one rule:

1116
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,383
Don't come into contact
with your forward self.

1117
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,052
It's the whole point of these barriers
and protective suits.

1118
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,637
We don't have time.

1119
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:53,847
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

1120
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:55,014
What?

1121
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,099
Annihilation.

1122
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:58,102
That would be bad, right?

1123
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:01,981
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

1124
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:03,440
Things will feel strange.

1125
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,652
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

1126
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,863
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

1127
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:11,615
as the transfer of heat is reversed.

1128
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:15,744
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

1129
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:19,248
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

1130
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:20,666
This is normal.

1131
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,513
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

1132
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,268
I can't vouch for the handling.

1133
01:30:24,295 --> 01:30:25,963
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

1134
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,716
You are inverted. The world is not.

1135
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:30,509
Was the transponder on the case?

1136
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:32,344
We've tossed that case.

1137
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:34,972
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

1138
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:36,807
Give me the reader.

1139
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,146
Okay.

1140
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,481
You ready?

1141
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,697
The material's not in the case.

1142
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:42,284
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

1143
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,578
He was lying.

1144
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:46,455
It wasn't in the BMW.

1145
01:33:46,622 --> 01:33:47,623
So, where is it?

1146
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:35,796
I saw the handoff.

1147
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:38,423
You made me shoot her for nothing.

1148
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:43,136
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

1149
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,847
Not even my wife.

1150
01:35:14,418 --> 01:35:17,004
You left Ives and his team
a hell of a cleanup.

1151
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,299
Heat transfer was reversed.

1152
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:22,968
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

1153
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:25,220
from a gasoline explosion in history.

1154
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:27,973
At this point, nothing surprises.

1155
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:30,767
We're headed back to Oslo?

1156
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,811
In a Rotas shipping container.

1157
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:34,306
He's got the material, Neil.

1158
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:36,940
I handed it to him on a plate.

1159
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,567
I warned you...

1160
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:39,860
What's happened's happened.

1161
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:41,570
I get it now.

1162
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:44,656
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

1163
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:46,533
That's not fair.

1164
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,785
You were a part of this before we met.

1165
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:50,616
Were you working for Priya?

1166
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:51,580
No.

1167
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:52,998
Who recruited you, Neil?

1168
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:56,668
It can't possibly do you any good
to know that right now.

1169
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:01,673
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

1170
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,468
then you can hear my life story, okay?

1171
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,472
I'm sorry I involved you.

1172
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,349
You need to tell me what's going on.

1173
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:13,226
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

1174
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:14,394
Good luck, pal.

1175
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:17,397
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

1176
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:20,025
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

1177
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:22,319
She has the right to know
why she might die.

1178
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:23,570
Am I gonna die?

1179
01:36:23,737 --> 01:36:25,337
Not if we have something
to say about it.

1180
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:26,405
And we do.

1181
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,158
Who are you?

1182
01:36:29,326 --> 01:36:32,829
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

1183
01:36:39,086 --> 01:36:41,126
The material's not in the case.

1184
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,424
Get the other sections of the algorithm
to the hypocenter.

1185
01:36:53,517 --> 01:36:54,559
You injured?

1186
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:02,359
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1187
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:07,406
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

1188
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:11,076
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

1189
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,911
so it can't be copied or communicated.

1190
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,622
It's a black box with one function.

1191
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:17,874
Which is?

1192
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,503
Inversion. But not objects or peoples.

1193
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:22,754
The world around us.

1194
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:23,922
I don't understand.

1195
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:27,217
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

1196
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:31,013
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

1197
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,224
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

1198
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:35,517
we dominate.

1199
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:37,269
They're always swimming upstream.

1200
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:38,562
It's what saved your life.

1201
01:37:38,729 --> 01:37:41,356
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

1202
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:42,691
Pissing in the wind.

1203
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:45,652
And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.

1204
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:48,196
It can invert the entropy of the world.

1205
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:50,157
And if that happens?

1206
01:37:50,449 --> 01:37:51,491
Oh...

1207
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,326
End of play.

1208
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:55,912
"End of play."
Can you be a little more precise?

1209
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,541
Everyone and everything
that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.

1210
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:00,709
Precise enough?

1211
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,502
Including my son.

1212
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:08,759
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

1213
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:25,859
On a truck.

1214
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:29,488
Shouldn't be long now.

1215
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,824
I've been thinking.

1216
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,826
We're their ancestors.

1217
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,537
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

1218
01:38:38,038 --> 01:38:40,123
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

1219
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,458
The what?

1220
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:43,794
If you went back in time

1221
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,240
and killed your own grandfather,

1222
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:47,380
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

1223
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:48,381
What's the answer?

1224
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,133
There's no answer. It's a paradox.

1225
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:51,801
But in the future,

1226
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:53,720
those in power clearly believe
that you can

1227
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:55,180
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1228
01:38:55,347 --> 01:38:56,973
gouge his eyes out,

1229
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,308
slit his throat,

1230
01:38:58,475 --> 01:38:59,601
without consequence.

1231
01:39:00,185 --> 01:39:01,812
Could they be right?

1232
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:03,438
Doesn't matter.

1233
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:05,357
They believe it.

1234
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:07,526
So they're willing to destroy us.

1235
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:10,946
Can I go back to sleep now?

1236
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,393
No. I thought of something else.

1237
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:13,365
Great.

1238
01:39:13,532 --> 01:39:15,659
This reversing the flow of time.

1239
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:18,453
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

1240
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:19,663
That we stop them?

1241
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,707
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.

1242
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,501
Pessimistically?

1243
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:27,420
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

1244
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:30,507
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

1245
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:31,925
Does your head hurt yet?

1246
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:33,260
Yes.

1247
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,598
Try to sleep.

1248
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:54,865
Shit.

1249
01:39:56,283 --> 01:39:58,243
They didn't take us inside.

1250
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:01,121
What do we do?

1251
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:05,500
We use the breach.

1252
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:07,794
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

1253
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:12,257
She healed enough?

1254
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:14,885
I don't know.

1255
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,511
I've never done this before.

1256
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:19,097
The fire crew's there.

1257
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:20,557
You take Kat through the breach,

1258
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,645
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

1259
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:24,227
Then you bring her in.

1260
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:26,771
How's your arm?

1261
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,481
Not good.

1262
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,863
We move as soon as we hear the engines.

1263
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:40,577
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

1264
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:41,953
You're bleeding.

1265
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:43,973
All right, let me take a look at it.

1266
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:51,671
Ready?

1267
01:41:24,663 --> 01:41:26,183
Wait here. I'm going in.

1268
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:24,656
Come on!

1269
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:25,992
Go, go, go!

1270
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:57,314
Go!

1271
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:41,312
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

1272
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:42,587
Why didn't you say?

1273
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:43,794
That's a lot of explaining

1274
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,858
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

1275
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:46,883
But afterwards?

1276
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:50,303
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.

1277
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,638
What's happened's happened.

1278
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:55,266
If I told you and you acted differently,
who knows?

1279
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,062
The policy is to suppress.

1280
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:01,272
Whose policy?

1281
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:02,607
Ours, my friend.

1282
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:09,155
We're the people saving the world
from what might've been.

1283
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:20,083
Kat?

1284
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:22,293
I'm here.

1285
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:24,462
It'll be quite a scar.

1286
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,130
You'll be okay.

1287
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:29,591
Did it.

1288
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,135
You did what?

1289
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,596
Andrei has the algorithm.

1290
01:46:34,764 --> 01:46:36,516
You don't know where he is.

1291
01:46:38,685 --> 01:46:39,894
Or when.

1292
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:43,565
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1293
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,401
If I don't do something, in two days,
she tells me about the 241.

1294
01:46:46,568 --> 01:46:47,735
Nothing can change that.

1295
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:49,153
We'll see.

1296
01:46:49,946 --> 01:46:51,281
Just get her here.

1297
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:54,988
Hello, Priya.

1298
01:46:55,952 --> 01:46:57,203
What's going on?

1299
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:58,788
Where's Neil?

1300
01:46:58,955 --> 01:47:02,458
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

1301
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:03,625
What did I do?

1302
01:47:03,668 --> 01:47:04,828
It's what you're going to do.

1303
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:07,589
In two days, you're gonna have me
dangle plutonium-241

1304
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:10,008
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1305
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:11,718
Now, I wanna know why.

1306
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:14,012
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1307
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:15,930
No, I let him get a hold
of the algorithm.

1308
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:19,392
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1309
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:22,520
It's... It's unique.

1310
01:47:22,687 --> 01:47:24,439
The scientist who built it
took her own life

1311
01:47:24,606 --> 01:47:26,208
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

1312
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:27,272
A scientist in the future?

1313
01:47:27,317 --> 01:47:28,443
Generations from now.

1314
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,028
Why does she have to kill herself?

1315
01:47:30,445 --> 01:47:32,363
You're familiar
with the Manhattan Project?

1316
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:35,325
As they approached
the first atomic test,

1317
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:36,826
Oppenheimer became concerned

1318
01:47:36,993 --> 01:47:39,704
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

1319
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:40,913
engulfing the world.

1320
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,874
They went ahead anyway and got lucky.

1321
01:47:42,999 --> 01:47:47,003
Think of our scientist
as her generation's Oppenheimer.

1322
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:49,922
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

1323
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:52,675
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

1324
01:47:52,842 --> 01:47:54,302
they're destroying themselves.

1325
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,220
The grandfather paradox.

1326
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,181
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1327
01:47:58,348 --> 01:47:59,599
she rebels,

1328
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:01,851
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

1329
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:04,395
and hiding them
the best place she can think of.

1330
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:05,980
The past.

1331
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:07,190
Here, now.

1332
01:48:07,357 --> 01:48:09,567
There are nine nuclear powers.

1333
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:10,735
Nine bombs.

1334
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:14,656
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

1335
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:16,783
The best hiding place possible.

1336
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:18,993
Nuclear containment facilities.

1337
01:48:19,786 --> 01:48:21,204
Sator's lifelong mission,

1338
01:48:21,371 --> 01:48:23,831
financed and guided by the future,
has been to

1339
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:26,209
find and reassemble the algorithm.

1340
01:48:26,376 --> 01:48:27,627
Why do they choose him?

1341
01:48:27,794 --> 01:48:29,730
Because he was at the right place
at the right time.

1342
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:31,923
The collapse of the Soviet Union.

1343
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:35,176
The most insecure moment
in the history of nuclear weapons.

1344
01:48:35,343 --> 01:48:37,512
How many sections does he have?

1345
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,263
After the 241, all nine.

1346
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,932
Jesus Christ.

1347
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:44,477
And that's why you're going
to do things differently this time.

1348
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:46,854
To change things?

1349
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,272
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1350
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,566
So Sator won't get the algorithm.

1351
01:48:52,652 --> 01:48:54,529
If that universe can exist...

1352
01:48:55,196 --> 01:48:56,197
we don't live in it.

1353
01:48:56,364 --> 01:48:57,657
Well, let's try.

1354
01:48:58,366 --> 01:49:00,076
You're going to warn me.

1355
01:49:00,243 --> 01:49:01,911
No, I'm not.

1356
01:49:02,078 --> 01:49:03,454
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1357
01:49:03,621 --> 01:49:04,664
Come on.

1358
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:07,083
If you had known what the algorithm was,

1359
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:09,377
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

1360
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:12,672
You want Sator to get the last section.

1361
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:15,341
That is the only way
he'll bring together the other eight.

1362
01:49:15,508 --> 01:49:17,176
I was supposed to steal it...

1363
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:18,720
then lose it?

1364
01:49:18,886 --> 01:49:20,263
Mission accomplished.

1365
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,223
You used me.

1366
01:49:23,266 --> 01:49:24,600
As you used Katherine.

1367
01:49:25,518 --> 01:49:27,186
Standard operating procedure.

1368
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:30,064
You've done your part.

1369
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:31,773
My part?

1370
01:49:32,108 --> 01:49:34,569
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

1371
01:49:34,736 --> 01:49:35,862
You...

1372
01:49:36,028 --> 01:49:37,822
are a protagonist.

1373
01:49:37,989 --> 01:49:40,825
Did you think you were the only one
capable of saving the world?

1374
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:46,622
No.

1375
01:49:47,999 --> 01:49:49,417
But I am.

1376
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:50,626
Because I haven't told you

1377
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:52,712
where he's assembling the algorithm
or when.

1378
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:53,963
You're about to.

1379
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:55,548
No, I'm not.

1380
01:49:55,715 --> 01:49:56,799
So, deal us in.

1381
01:49:58,009 --> 01:49:59,051
HUS"?

1382
01:49:59,594 --> 01:50:01,113
Why would you want to involve her again?

1383
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:02,457
Because she can get close to him.

1384
01:50:02,597 --> 01:50:03,890
Does he still trust her?

1385
01:50:04,056 --> 01:50:05,224
He thinks she's dead.

1386
01:50:05,391 --> 01:50:06,559
But he used to.

1387
01:50:06,726 --> 01:50:09,020
You have started looking at the world
in a new way.

1388
01:50:09,187 --> 01:50:10,563
And now, it's your turn.

1389
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:12,315
Assuming she makes it out alive,

1390
01:50:12,398 --> 01:50:14,358
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

1391
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:15,359
I can't.

1392
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:16,712
If you don't have the authority,

1393
01:50:16,736 --> 01:50:19,363
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

1394
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,282
I need your word

1395
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:23,910
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

1396
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:26,534
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1397
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:33,335
They'll be safe.

1398
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:37,381
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

1399
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:39,008
Get yourselves up there.

1400
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:40,968
Ives has a team ready to invert.

1401
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,535
You have a turnstile?

1402
01:50:42,595 --> 01:50:45,139
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

1403
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:47,433
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

1404
01:50:48,017 --> 01:50:50,311
But there are some people,
in the future,

1405
01:50:50,478 --> 01:50:53,606
who want to continue
the algorithm's journey into the past.

1406
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:56,275
You see...

1407
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:59,237
Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

1408
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:02,073
It will be founded in the future.

1409
01:51:28,808 --> 01:51:30,643
Can't get over the birds.

1410
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:32,562
How're you feeling?

1411
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,443
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1412
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,028
I can't.

1413
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,280
Why not?

1414
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:44,282
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

1415
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,492
Not with a dead man's switch.

1416
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:48,411
The fitness tracker he wears.

1417
01:51:48,828 --> 01:51:50,108
He's obsessive about his health.

1418
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:51,473
It'll be linked to a switch,

1419
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:53,624
probably a simple e-mail burst

1420
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:55,388
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

1421
01:51:55,501 --> 01:51:57,336
set to fire if his heart stops.

1422
01:51:57,503 --> 01:51:59,672
His death activates the algorithm.

1423
01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:01,340
He dies, the world ends.

1424
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:03,259
No one dares kill him.

1425
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,555
No, you've missed the point.

1426
01:52:09,891 --> 01:52:11,309
He's intending to end his life.

1427
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:14,769
Why?

1428
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:17,815
He's dying.

1429
01:52:18,858 --> 01:52:20,902
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1430
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:24,447
And he's taking the world with him.

1431
01:52:24,614 --> 01:52:26,657
If he can't have her, no one can.

1432
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:30,661
He gets to choose the time and place
for the end of the world.

1433
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:33,497
What moment? What does he choose?

1434
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:38,252
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1435
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:39,962
Vietnam.

1436
01:52:40,129 --> 01:52:41,756
You said he vanished. What day?

1437
01:52:41,923 --> 01:52:44,693
I went ashore with Max and he flew off,
but I don't know what day it was.

1438
01:52:44,717 --> 01:52:46,802
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1439
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:47,970
He was in Ukraine.

1440
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:49,931
At the Kiev opera siege.

1441
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,391
How do you know about that?

1442
01:52:53,768 --> 01:52:56,088
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht,
so that's his window.

1443
01:52:56,145 --> 01:52:58,564
To go back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.

1444
01:52:58,731 --> 01:52:59,931
Everyone's last.

1445
01:53:00,232 --> 01:53:02,112
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

1446
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:03,194
without Sator knowing.

1447
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:05,571
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

1448
01:53:05,738 --> 01:53:07,198
And not the rest of us.

1449
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:08,449
Where's the dead drop?

1450
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:10,159
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1451
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,327
You're not gonna tell me?

1452
01:53:11,494 --> 01:53:12,614
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1453
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:14,664
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.

1454
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:15,873
Why?

1455
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:19,043
You have to stop him killing himself
until we know the algorithm

1456
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:21,087
is out of the dead drop.

1457
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:23,255
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.

1458
01:53:23,422 --> 01:53:25,150
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

1459
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:27,176
if they're gonna be his last.

1460
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,095
They're not.

1461
01:53:54,245 --> 01:53:55,245
It's time.

1462
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:56,998
We're working our way back to the 14th,

1463
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,761
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

1464
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:01,043
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

1465
01:54:02,378 --> 01:54:04,213
You know what a hypocenter is?

1466
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,925
It's ground zero
for an underground nuclear test.

1467
01:54:08,092 --> 01:54:13,139
Sir Michael Crosby told me about
a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1468
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:15,391
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

1469
01:54:15,558 --> 01:54:18,561
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1470
01:54:18,644 --> 01:54:20,330
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

1471
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:22,356
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1472
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,152
Line it up.

1473
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:27,570
Move forward.

1474
01:54:29,697 --> 01:54:30,698
Next.

1475
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:35,995
Line it up.

1476
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:38,956
Where's Neil?

1477
01:54:42,126 --> 01:54:43,406
He must've gone through already.

1478
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:44,622
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1479
01:54:45,296 --> 01:54:46,756
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1480
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:48,299
I'd like to say...

1481
01:54:48,799 --> 01:54:50,318
that you don't have to do this, Kat...

1482
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:53,721
Worst thing Andrei ever did to me
was that offer he made me.

1483
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:56,891
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

1484
01:54:58,225 --> 01:54:59,977
I shouted and...

1485
01:55:00,311 --> 01:55:01,729
Swore.

1486
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:04,774
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

1487
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:09,695
I considered it.

1488
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:12,740
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1489
01:55:12,907 --> 01:55:14,742
or because he knows that about me.

1490
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,243
Oh.

1491
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:19,747
A chance to help save my child.

1492
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,510
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

1493
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:22,750
No.

1494
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:24,794
You've killed people
you've hated before.

1495
01:55:25,294 --> 01:55:26,587
It's not usually personal.

1496
01:55:26,754 --> 01:55:28,732
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1497
01:55:28,756 --> 01:55:30,382
It always counts, Kat.

1498
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,511
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

1499
01:55:34,512 --> 01:55:37,014
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

1500
01:55:37,181 --> 01:55:38,808
he takes us all with him.

1501
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:43,604
You just keep up your end, okay?

1502
01:55:47,775 --> 01:55:49,015
Today's the 14th.

1503
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:50,694
Offshore of Siberia.

1504
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:52,196
Time for us to go.

1505
01:55:52,363 --> 01:55:53,643
You keep going back another day,

1506
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:55,533
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

1507
01:55:55,699 --> 01:55:56,843
And who gets me on the yacht?

1508
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:58,147
I've got somebody good lined up.

1509
01:55:58,244 --> 01:56:01,330
When it's over, when you're raising
your boy, carry this.

1510
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:04,125
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

1511
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,961
Hit "talk," state your location,
hang up.

1512
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:09,004
Who gets the message?

1513
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:11,090
Posterity.

1514
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:51,839
Stalsk-12.

1515
01:56:52,006 --> 01:56:55,384
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

1516
01:56:55,551 --> 01:56:59,722
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1517
01:56:59,889 --> 01:57:03,475
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1518
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:04,935
We're Red Team, moving forward.

1519
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:07,605
In order to distinguish the teams,
you'll wear these.

1520
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:08,939
Our friends over there,

1521
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:11,483
Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler,
are inverted.

1522
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:13,402
Why don't they let us see them?

1523
01:57:13,903 --> 01:57:15,263
Maybe we won't like what happened.

1524
01:57:15,404 --> 01:57:18,240
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

1525
01:57:20,201 --> 01:57:23,454
Then, were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter,

1526
01:57:23,621 --> 01:57:25,831
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

1527
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:29,835
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

1528
01:57:30,002 --> 01:57:33,756
Now, this briefing
has the benefit of their experience.

1529
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:52,524
Both teams have countdown watches.

1530
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:55,069
Ours counts down from ten, from landing

1531
01:57:55,236 --> 01:57:56,695
to zero to the explosion.

1532
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:58,798
- Blue Team is reversed.
- Everybody, look to your left.

1533
01:57:58,822 --> 01:58:02,826
If you are not at the LZ at zero,
you are not leaving.

1534
01:58:03,911 --> 01:58:05,204
Do you understand?

1535
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:08,999
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.

1536
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:10,793
We make our way into the city proper.

1537
01:58:10,918 --> 01:58:13,379
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

1538
01:58:13,545 --> 01:58:15,005
there is a turnstile.

1539
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:17,091
Expect a bitemporal response.

1540
01:58:17,258 --> 01:58:18,676
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1541
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:21,095
Inverse, conventional,

1542
01:58:21,262 --> 01:58:23,764
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

1543
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:25,891
On the other side of the city,

1544
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:28,435
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

1545
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:31,814
A splinter unit
will take this tunnel from the city

1546
01:58:31,981 --> 01:58:33,816
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1547
01:58:33,983 --> 01:58:36,527
Blue Team located an entrance here.

1548
01:58:36,694 --> 01:58:38,737
The bomb is in this rock,

1549
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:41,740
high above, to trigger a collapse,

1550
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:42,950
sealing the cavern.

1551
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:44,576
How do we defuse the bomb up there?

1552
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:47,246
We don't.
The explosion takes place as planned.

1553
01:58:47,413 --> 01:58:51,250
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

1554
01:58:51,417 --> 01:58:54,795
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1555
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:55,920
Which is?

1556
01:58:56,005 --> 01:58:57,131
Need-to-know, and you don't.

1557
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,758
Any other stupid questions?

1558
01:59:00,134 --> 01:59:02,428
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.

1559
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:06,765
I wanted to be on the first wave.

1560
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,309
There is no first wave.

1561
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:10,936
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.

1562
01:59:11,103 --> 01:59:12,103
Look,

1563
01:59:12,187 --> 01:59:14,867
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1564
01:59:15,024 --> 01:59:18,444
Now, you wanna be on the team
that lifts the contents of the capsule?

1565
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,112
Absolutely.

1566
01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:22,156
Yeah, that's us.

1567
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:24,158
We're splinter unit.

1568
01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:25,409
Just us?

1569
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:29,079
No one who knows the contents
of that capsule can leave the field.

1570
01:59:29,997 --> 01:59:32,458
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1571
01:59:42,343 --> 01:59:44,321
It's 40 feet
from the private deck to the water.

1572
01:59:44,345 --> 01:59:45,345
Can you jump it?

1573
01:59:45,888 --> 01:59:47,389
I can dive it.

1574
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,933
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.

1575
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:27,262
Thirty seconds!

1576
02:01:08,345 --> 02:01:09,346
Go! Go! Go!

1577
02:01:21,191 --> 02:01:22,985
We're coming in on a shockwave.

1578
02:01:23,152 --> 02:01:24,319
Hang on, people.

1579
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:34,788
On your feet!

1580
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:49,887
There!

1581
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:04,794
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

1582
02:02:04,818 --> 02:02:06,338
Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

1583
02:02:06,445 --> 02:02:07,362
Oh, the boss left.

1584
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:11,074
Well, have Mr. Sator find me here.

1585
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:12,534
And don't tell the others.

1586
02:02:12,701 --> 02:02:13,952
I'll get the mess.

1587
02:03:21,562 --> 02:03:22,563
Mines!

1588
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:23,771
Mines!

1589
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:39,638
They told me you'd gone ashore.

1590
02:03:41,707 --> 02:03:42,867
They told me you'd flown off.

1591
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,127
I came back to see you and Max.

1592
02:03:45,294 --> 02:03:47,170
Max is on shore with Anna.

1593
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:50,358
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1594
02:03:50,382 --> 02:03:52,759
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

1595
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:54,928
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1596
02:03:55,095 --> 02:03:58,515
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1597
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:08,775
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1598
02:04:24,416 --> 02:04:25,584
Take cover!

1599
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:31,757
Get me a goddamn AT4!

1600
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:33,175
Take him out, now!

1601
02:04:33,759 --> 02:04:35,177
Provide some cover!

1602
02:04:35,344 --> 02:04:37,179
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1603
02:04:37,346 --> 02:04:38,639
Move, move, move!

1604
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Wheeler!

1605
02:05:51,545 --> 02:05:52,546
Get outta there!

1606
02:05:52,713 --> 02:05:53,880
Come on!

1607
02:05:59,553 --> 02:06:00,553
Ives!

1608
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:04,266
Splinter unit. Here.

1609
02:06:06,059 --> 02:06:08,186
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

1610
02:06:08,353 --> 02:06:12,315
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

1611
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,943
I'll make you a drink.

1612
02:06:15,902 --> 02:06:17,904
Bring my son back to the boat.

1613
02:06:24,411 --> 02:06:25,722
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!

1614
02:06:25,746 --> 02:06:27,831
If they see us, it's all for nothing.

1615
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:32,753
We need a distraction.

1616
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:34,463
Don't worry about that.

1617
02:06:38,133 --> 02:06:39,551
On my mark!

1618
02:06:42,387 --> 02:06:44,014
RPG, hit the base!

1619
02:06:45,056 --> 02:06:46,336
That building on my mark!

1620
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:50,020
Three! Two!

1621
02:06:50,187 --> 02:06:51,938
One! Fire!

1622
02:06:53,064 --> 02:06:54,232
Fire!

1623
02:07:09,206 --> 02:07:10,540
Move! Move!

1624
02:07:26,264 --> 02:07:28,266
We're committed now.
Come on.

1625
02:07:34,564 --> 02:07:36,149
What's that?

1626
02:07:36,316 --> 02:07:38,777
I borrowed it from the CIA.

1627
02:07:40,111 --> 02:07:41,154
What is it?

1628
02:07:41,321 --> 02:07:43,573
The way the world ends.

1629
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:46,201
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1630
02:07:46,618 --> 02:07:48,328
I don't understand.

1631
02:07:48,495 --> 02:07:50,413
When I take this, it's all over.

1632
02:07:51,331 --> 02:07:53,208
Then don't take it yet.

1633
02:07:56,253 --> 02:07:57,879
Why not?

1634
02:07:59,464 --> 02:08:01,383
Because we have the sunset coming.

1635
02:08:01,842 --> 02:08:04,302
And a little vodka left.

1636
02:08:04,469 --> 02:08:06,429
And Max will be here soon.

1637
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:10,600
They said they thought it was you,
not Anna, ashore with Max.

1638
02:08:13,436 --> 02:08:16,857
So long as you can tell the difference.

1639
02:08:19,025 --> 02:08:21,653
A moment's business, my love.

1640
02:08:33,874 --> 02:08:35,166
<i>Mahir, do you copy?</i>

1641
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:38,378
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!

1642
02:08:38,545 --> 02:08:39,546
Copy that.

1643
02:08:39,796 --> 02:08:42,924
I repeat, not clear!

1644
02:09:09,451 --> 02:09:10,535
Neil!

1645
02:09:11,328 --> 02:09:12,412
Neil!

1646
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,426
Go!

1647
02:09:35,352 --> 02:09:38,021
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

1648
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:45,987
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

1649
02:09:50,742 --> 02:09:51,743
Anything?

1650
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:52,990
Nah, nothing.

1651
02:09:53,036 --> 02:09:55,116
Here, you try having a Ilook.
Can you pick it?

1652
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:57,040
I hope not.

1653
02:09:57,207 --> 02:09:59,042
I paid a lot for that lock.

1654
02:09:59,209 --> 02:10:01,962
How do you like where my journey began
and yours ends?

1655
02:10:02,128 --> 02:10:03,630
Little radioactive for my taste.

1656
02:10:03,797 --> 02:10:06,716
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

1657
02:10:07,926 --> 02:10:10,303
We'd work where no one else would.

1658
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:13,181
I made a bargain with the devil.

1659
02:10:13,348 --> 02:10:14,933
Money for time.

1660
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:17,018
We sold our futures.

1661
02:10:17,185 --> 02:10:19,938
And now you're about to make
the same mistake for the entire world.

1662
02:10:20,605 --> 02:10:23,400
It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.

1663
02:10:23,566 --> 02:10:24,776
What was yours?

1664
02:10:24,943 --> 02:10:27,445
You fight for a cause
you barely understand...

1665
02:10:28,196 --> 02:10:31,700
with people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.

1666
02:10:31,866 --> 02:10:33,952
When I die, the world dies with me.

1667
02:10:34,119 --> 02:10:36,204
And your knowledge dies with you,

1668
02:10:36,371 --> 02:10:39,874
buried in a tomb
like an anonymous Egyptian builder

1669
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:42,460
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.

1670
02:10:42,627 --> 02:10:45,046
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

1671
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:08,337
What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?

1672
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:10,780
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.

1673
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:15,201
Somewhere, sometime, a man
in a crystalline tower throws a switch

1674
02:11:15,785 --> 02:11:19,372
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

1675
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:22,917
Now time itself switches direction.

1676
02:11:23,084 --> 02:11:25,420
The same sunshine we basked in

1677
02:11:25,587 --> 02:11:29,424
will warm the faces of our descendants
generations to come.

1678
02:11:29,591 --> 02:11:31,509
How could they wanna kill us?

1679
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:34,846
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1680
02:11:35,013 --> 02:11:38,600
Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.

1681
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:41,186
We're responsible.

1682
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:57,243
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

1683
02:11:58,536 --> 02:11:59,621
Yes.

1684
02:12:00,288 --> 02:12:02,332
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

1685
02:12:02,499 --> 02:12:04,334
That's exactly what they're doing.

1686
02:12:04,501 --> 02:12:06,669
But not you. You're a traitor.

1687
02:12:06,836 --> 02:12:09,756
Bringing death to all, because
you have no life of your own left.

1688
02:12:09,923 --> 02:12:11,633
When I'm done, life continues.

1689
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,384
Not your son's.

1690
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:17,180
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1691
02:12:17,347 --> 02:12:19,140
You think God will forgive me?

1692
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:26,106
Wait!

1693
02:12:27,107 --> 02:12:28,108
Wait!

1694
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,527
God...

1695
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:43,373
Cover me!

1696
02:12:51,256 --> 02:12:53,091
Go! Go! Go!

1697
02:12:54,926 --> 02:12:57,554
You don't believe in God, or a future,

1698
02:12:57,637 --> 02:12:59,681
or anything outside
of your own experience.

1699
02:12:59,848 --> 02:13:02,267
The rest is belief.

1700
02:13:02,809 --> 02:13:04,769
And I don't have it.

1701
02:13:05,395 --> 02:13:07,313
Without it, you're not human.

1702
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,898
You're just a madman.

1703
02:13:09,524 --> 02:13:11,526
Or a god.

1704
02:13:11,693 --> 02:13:12,527
Of sorts.

1705
02:13:12,694 --> 02:13:13,736
Like I said.

1706
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:18,491
Don't. Jesus.

1707
02:13:19,117 --> 02:13:20,326
Our time is up.

1708
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:29,043
I'll give your love to my wife.

1709
02:13:29,711 --> 02:13:31,588
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

1710
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:33,130
That's right.

1711
02:13:33,256 --> 02:13:34,883
After you meet her, she dies.

1712
02:13:35,049 --> 02:13:37,510
I'll just give her my love instead.

1713
02:13:38,803 --> 02:13:39,803
Don't do...

1714
02:13:41,264 --> 02:13:42,682
Volkov...

1715
02:13:56,196 --> 02:13:57,989
Enough business, my love.

1716
02:14:25,183 --> 02:14:27,810
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

1717
02:14:30,021 --> 02:14:32,607
But it sounds terribly important.

1718
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:35,985
Where are you going?

1719
02:14:36,152 --> 02:14:37,403
Aren't you hot?

1720
02:14:54,128 --> 02:14:55,171
What are you doing now?

1721
02:14:55,672 --> 02:14:57,048
I spilled sunscreen.

1722
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,425
- So what?
- Slippery!

1723
02:15:02,762 --> 02:15:04,180
Just come here.

1724
02:15:07,433 --> 02:15:08,434
Turn over.

1725
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:10,186
You'll like it.

1726
02:15:44,721 --> 02:15:46,097
I can't do this.

1727
02:15:47,223 --> 02:15:49,660
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1728
02:15:49,684 --> 02:15:52,364
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1729
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:56,524
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1730
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:57,876
Come on, come on, come on!

1731
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,236
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.

1732
02:16:00,737 --> 02:16:02,238
Mahir, do you copy?

1733
02:16:02,697 --> 02:16:03,531
Yeah.

1734
02:16:03,698 --> 02:16:05,533
Hold. I repeat, hold!

1735
02:16:10,872 --> 02:16:11,914
Look in my eyes.

1736
02:16:13,458 --> 02:16:14,917
Which do you see?

1737
02:16:16,044 --> 02:16:18,963
Despair or anger?

1738
02:16:20,548 --> 02:16:22,508
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

1739
02:16:22,592 --> 02:16:24,552
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

1740
02:16:26,346 --> 02:16:30,183
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1741
02:16:33,394 --> 02:16:34,395
No!

1742
02:16:53,581 --> 02:16:54,581
Shit.

1743
02:16:54,999 --> 02:16:57,679
<i>Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.</i>

1744
02:16:58,044 --> 02:17:00,797
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

1745
02:17:19,232 --> 02:17:21,776
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

1746
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,448
Ah, screw it.

1747
02:18:38,144 --> 02:18:40,688
Kat!
You jumped the gun!

1748
02:18:40,855 --> 02:18:42,523
I couldn't do it.

1749
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:44,692
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

1750
02:18:44,901 --> 02:18:46,986
I knew you'd find a way.

1751
02:18:47,737 --> 02:18:49,572
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

1752
02:18:49,739 --> 02:18:51,866
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.

1753
02:19:13,596 --> 02:19:14,847
Thought you were inverted.

1754
02:19:15,223 --> 02:19:16,933
Changed gears halfway.

1755
02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:20,144
Looked like you needed help here.

1756
02:19:20,311 --> 02:19:22,438
Here?
We needed help down there.

1757
02:19:23,731 --> 02:19:24,941
How'd you get that lock open?

1758
02:19:25,983 --> 02:19:28,069
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?

1759
02:19:29,153 --> 02:19:30,863
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1760
02:19:31,656 --> 02:19:32,656
All right, Ives?

1761
02:19:33,199 --> 02:19:35,039
Once I've caught my breath.

1762
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:51,509
No one who's seen this leaves the field.

1763
02:20:00,393 --> 02:20:01,894
All right.

1764
02:20:05,398 --> 02:20:06,774
We hide it.

1765
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:09,151
We end our lives.

1766
02:20:09,902 --> 02:20:12,113
That's the only way to be sure.

1767
02:20:13,864 --> 02:20:15,741
As to when...

1768
02:20:16,158 --> 02:20:18,536
maybe that's every man's decision
to make for himself.

1769
02:20:19,662 --> 02:20:20,955
You're not gonna Kill us?

1770
02:20:21,122 --> 02:20:23,499
If I ever find you, I will.

1771
02:20:23,666 --> 02:20:25,126
But you won't look too hard?

1772
02:20:26,168 --> 02:20:27,336
Yes, I will.

1773
02:20:31,132 --> 02:20:33,235
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

1774
02:20:33,259 --> 02:20:34,093
No.

1775
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:35,803
It's far too dangerous.

1776
02:20:36,637 --> 02:20:38,222
Even from afar?

1777
02:20:39,473 --> 02:20:40,891
Even from afar.

1778
02:20:43,185 --> 02:20:44,353
Ives!

1779
02:20:45,354 --> 02:20:46,606
Wait.

1780
02:20:52,945 --> 02:20:54,447
Are you really going back in?

1781
02:20:57,325 --> 02:21:00,161
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives??

1782
02:21:00,536 --> 02:21:02,997
Well, I don't know any locksmiths
as good as you.

1783
02:21:04,457 --> 02:21:05,541
See?

1784
02:21:06,292 --> 02:21:08,127
It's me in there, again.

1785
02:21:08,753 --> 02:21:11,672
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

1786
02:21:20,264 --> 02:21:21,264
Neil, wait!

1787
02:21:25,645 --> 02:21:27,271
Just saved the world.

1788
02:21:27,772 --> 02:21:29,649
Can't leave anything to chance.

1789
02:21:30,232 --> 02:21:32,485
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

1790
02:21:33,152 --> 02:21:35,363
"What's happened's happened."

1791
02:21:35,529 --> 02:21:38,532
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1792
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,743
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1793
02:21:41,327 --> 02:21:42,161
Fate?

1794
02:21:42,328 --> 02:21:43,663
Call it what you want.

1795
02:21:44,121 --> 02:21:45,122
What do you call it?

1796
02:21:45,998 --> 02:21:47,124
Reality.

1797
02:21:49,794 --> 02:21:51,087
Now let me go.

1798
02:21:56,801 --> 02:21:59,345
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1799
02:21:59,512 --> 02:22:01,222
Haven't you guessed by now?

1800
02:22:02,223 --> 02:22:03,223
You did.

1801
02:22:03,933 --> 02:22:06,477
Only not when you thought.

1802
02:22:06,644 --> 02:22:08,979
You have a future in the past.

1803
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:12,108
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

1804
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:14,568
You've known me for years?

1805
02:22:16,404 --> 02:22:20,199
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1806
02:22:20,366 --> 02:22:22,159
But for me, it's just the beginning.

1807
02:22:22,868 --> 02:22:24,787
We get up to some stuff.

1808
02:22:25,204 --> 02:22:27,665
You're gonna love it. You'll see.

1809
02:22:28,541 --> 02:22:30,793
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

1810
02:22:31,377 --> 02:22:32,628
Whose?

1811
02:22:34,088 --> 02:22:35,089
Yours!

1812
02:22:35,881 --> 02:22:37,425
You're only halfway there.

1813
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:39,385
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

1814
02:22:48,185 --> 02:22:51,355
We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

1815
02:22:51,522 --> 02:22:53,282
<i>World will never know
what could've happened.</i>

1816
02:22:55,276 --> 02:22:58,070
And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.

1817
02:23:02,366 --> 02:23:04,618
'Cause no one cares
about the bomb that didn't go off.

1818
02:23:06,162 --> 02:23:07,371
Only the one that did.

1819
02:23:09,999 --> 02:23:11,226
Do it before the boy comes out.

1820
02:23:14,086 --> 02:23:17,131
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1821
02:23:17,298 --> 02:23:20,342
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

1822
02:23:20,843 --> 02:23:22,720
Here, today.

1823
02:23:24,096 --> 02:23:25,598
How did you know?

1824
02:23:27,725 --> 02:23:30,311
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1825
02:23:30,811 --> 02:23:31,645
Posterity.

1826
02:23:31,812 --> 02:23:35,274
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1827
02:23:36,108 --> 02:23:39,028
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1828
02:23:39,904 --> 02:23:42,740
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1829
02:23:42,823 --> 02:23:43,991
Then whose was it?

1830
02:23:44,074 --> 02:23:45,493
Mine.

1831
02:23:45,659 --> 02:23:48,746
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1832
02:23:49,455 --> 02:23:51,290
I'm the protagonist.

1833
02:23:53,834 --> 02:23:55,836
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

1834
02:23:59,715 --> 02:24:01,133
Mission accomplished.

1835
02:24:03,219 --> 02:24:04,859
It's the bomb that didn't go off.

1836
02:24:05,596 --> 02:24:08,057
The danger no one knew was real.

1837
02:24:13,604 --> 02:24:16,440
That's the bomb
with the real power to change the world.

Fixed and synced by Ashish Thakur

1839
02:24:36,335 --> 02:24:39,588
You

1840
02:24:40,756 --> 02:24:45,761
Don't know where we stand

1841
02:24:47,930 --> 02:24:52,393
It's true

1842
02:24:53,519 --> 02:24:58,941
Know the plan

1843
02:25:01,861 --> 02:25:04,655
Last time I wrecked it
Last time I whipped around

1844
02:25:04,738 --> 02:25:07,575
Last time I did the whippets
Last time [ live reverse

1845
02:25:07,658 --> 02:25:10,494
Pour the brown, hit the reverend
Last time I hit your crib

1846
02:25:10,578 --> 02:25:11,996
Last time there weren't no tenants

1847
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:14,206
I done went back in myself
Felt like hell

1848
02:25:14,290 --> 02:25:15,833
Felt like I risked it
Pace yourself

1849
02:25:15,916 --> 02:25:18,127
Found you livin', know you thrillin'
Not for sinnin'

1850
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:21,046
How I got my stripes and pendants
Backin' out in the street

1851
02:25:21,130 --> 02:25:23,966
What is wild, let it be
Ragers out, gotta eat

1852
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:27,052
Not a vibe, but a wave
With the sound, by the way

1853
02:25:27,136 --> 02:25:28,596
Count it down, by the days

1854
02:25:28,679 --> 02:25:30,973
To myself, know they wicked
With the moves

1855
02:25:31,056 --> 02:25:33,267
I'm drinkin', off the juice
Know I'm drinkin'

1856
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:36,645
I be smooth, then I lose it
Yeah, yeah, now

1857
02:25:36,729 --> 02:25:39,773
You

1858
02:25:40,774 --> 02:25:45,779
Don't know where we stand

1859
02:25:46,572 --> 02:25:48,782
Yeah, yeah

1860
02:25:48,866 --> 02:25:53,412
It's true

1861
02:25:53,495 --> 02:25:58,000
Know the plan

1862
02:26:01,795 --> 02:26:03,380
Close the opera

1863
02:26:03,464 --> 02:26:06,258
Hear the red and blue outside
I think our option's up

1864
02:26:06,342 --> 02:26:09,178
I recrossed it 'round the map
I had to line it up

1865
02:26:09,261 --> 02:26:12,097
I be swervin' on the waves
It's like a line of us

1866
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:15,059
Move in 'verse on my turf
I'm outta line, I put in work

1867
02:26:15,142 --> 02:26:16,769
I draw the line and cross it first

1868
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:18,228
I need the time, I need to search

1869
02:26:18,312 --> 02:26:19,813
It's just like wine, it make it worse

1870
02:26:19,897 --> 02:26:21,982
Skrrt, skrrt in the 'vert
Skrrt, skrrt

1871
02:26:22,066 --> 02:26:24,276
Ride on land, Boeing jet, make it land

1872
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,819
In slow motion when I dance

1873
02:26:25,903 --> 02:26:28,822
In your eyes I see your trance
I run away and then you prance

1874
02:26:28,906 --> 02:26:31,825
If I show the hideaway
Will you hide out and let it blam?

1875
02:26:31,909 --> 02:26:36,789
Ain't no time, I'm facin' scams
Nah, nah

1876
02:26:36,872 --> 02:26:39,625
You

1877
02:26:40,834 --> 02:26:45,839
Don't know where we stand

1878
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:47,883
Yeah

1879
02:26:47,967 --> 02:26:52,471
It's true

1880
02:26:54,556 --> 02:26:59,228
Ooh

1881
02:27:12,449 --> 02:27:15,703
You
