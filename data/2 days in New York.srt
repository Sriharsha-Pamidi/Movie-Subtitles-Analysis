Dark? She's dark now?

Come on, admit it.
She's got a dark side.

1111
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,755
And I believe she's gonna
end up being Goth.

I mean, she's borderline Goth.

2032
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:49,957
Why don't you get it yourself?

2033
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,292
Okay.

2034
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,878
And by the way, why do you laugh
every time you say my name?

2035
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,422
Oh, Mingus,
please don't be mad.

2036
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,091
It was a stupid joke between me
and that stupid Manu.

2037
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:03,262
Your name--it rhymes
with "cunnilingus," and in French--

2038
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,097
And in English, too!

2039
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,099
Okay.

2040
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,934
Thank you. Thank you.
It all makes sense now.

2041
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:12,021
[laughing]
Mingus, cunnilingus.

2042
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,773
- Oh, man, yes, yes.
- Yes.

2043
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,692
Oh, Mingus, can you
get me some ice?

2044
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,153
La la la. Mingus,
can you get the ketchup?

2045
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,071
La la la.
Mingus, can you get my shoe?

2046
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,865
La la la.

2047
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,534
Can you remind me again
what you do for a living?

2048
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,870
- I--
- You're a shrink for kids.

2049
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,790
That is so scary.

2050
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,542
Sick.

2051
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:39,131
If there's a tiny little chance
that it does exist,

2052
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,383
I think it's a good idea
that I have a backup,

2053
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,095
you know, a sort
of "in case I need it" soul.

2054
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,222
Well, let's say the soul does exist.

2055
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,224
It's very unlikely you can just sell it

2056
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,434
by signing a little piece of paper, right?

2057
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,603
I disagree with you.

2058
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,357
The concept of a soul is a little absurd,

2059
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,859
but the idea of trading it, selling it

2060
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:03,739
is no more absurd than the idea
that the soul exists.

2061
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,618
Do you miss your soul?

2062
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,662
Of course not.
[ blows raspberry]

2063
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,331
[ Blows raspberry]
Yeah, mm-hmm, okay.

2064
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,125
I'm just trying to think, if I s--

2065
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,628
if I lost my soul,
how would that feel?

2066
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:18,796
I mean, that's, uh...

2067
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,881
I couldn't imagine that. I--

2068
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,094
I might start to cry.

2069
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,847
Where is, uh, the contract?

2070
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,351
Someone picked it up
at the gallery, so you--

2071
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,394
Where is it?

2072
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:37,064
Why do you ask?

2073
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:39,149
I need it back.
Just give it to me back.

2074
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,694
I know you sent the money
already to the bank,

2075
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,280
but I can make you--
make you a check right now,

2076
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,906
and you give it back to me.

2077
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:48,409
And it's no big deal, right?

2078
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,411
No.

2079
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,579
It's not for sale,

2080
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,290
not for any price, not for anything.

2081
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,208
I'm sorry.

2082
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,835
- But it's mine.
- No.

2083
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,795
You decided to sell it.

2084
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:03,340
I decided to buy it,
and now it's mine.

2085
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,425
Please tell me where it is.

2086
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,385
I just want to know where it is,
that it's in a safe place.

2087
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,846
GALLO:
It's in a safe place, baby.

2088
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,181
It's very safe.
It's in a very, very safe place--

01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,600
my favourite place.

2090
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,646
It's in a little suede pouch

2091
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,024
in the colour brown.

2092
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:24,653
Tiny, little pouch.
It's rolled up, placed in the pouch,

2093
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,655
and I keep it right here

2094
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,490
in my groin area.

2095
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:35,164
Safe, protected.

MINGUS:
So you're not dead.

2098
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,139
I said I wasn't gonna get mad.

2099
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,809
But you know what?
Where have you been?

2100
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:56,977
I'm sorry.
I couldn't call you.

2101
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,437
My phone ran out of battery,

2102
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,522
and then I was trying
to get my soul back,

2103
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,193
and he ate it.

2104
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,444
Who ate what?

2105
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,781
Vincent Gallo.

2106
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,534
Vincent Gallo?
So that's where you've been?

2107
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,788
Well, first, I got a massage
because I was tense, okay?

2108
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,581
And then I finally found out, like,

2109
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,250
who's the anonymous person
who bought my soul.

2110
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,378
So I called,
and we had a meeting,

2111
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,504
and it was Vincent Gallo,

2112
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,465
and then--and then I tried
to negotiate with him--

2113
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,925
my soul back.

2114
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,593
And the paper--
he had the paper with him.

2115
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,929
The certificate I signed.
I just want it back,

2116
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,097
not because
I believe in the soul,

2117
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,848
but because I believe

2118
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,059
something was wrong with me
ever since I signed that paper.

2119
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,478
So he had it in a little area,

2120
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:43,565
he said, like in a suede pouch
next to his groin area, you know?

2121
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,026
I lunged at him,
and I grabbed the pouch,

2122
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,778
and I punched him in the face,

2123
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,988
and then he punched me
in the stomach,

2124
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,990
and then we punched
back and forth.

2125
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,035
And then we--
we fell to the floor.

2126
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:58,205
And then he--
he grabbed it,

2127
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,749
[sobbing ]
and he ate it.

2128
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,751
So you spent all night

2129
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,337
in Vincent Gallo's pants
on the floor?

2130
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,548
- No, it's not what you think.
- That's what you just said.

2131
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,216
- No, no, no.
- That's what you just said.

2132
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,843
No, that's not at all what I said.

2133
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,263
I said he had my soul
in his underwear.

2134
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,807
Okay? It's very different.

2135
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,976
No, it's not fucking different.

2136
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:21,728
You're fucking going cra--
Ever since your family got here,

2137
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,397
you've become another person.

2138
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:24,481
Now the question is,

2139
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,275
is this who you really are

2140
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,861
and you've just been hiding it
from me the whole time?

2141
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,781
Or this is just some isolated incident
that'll never happen again?

2142
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,033
What is it?

2143
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,161

I'm not a psycho bitch, sweetie.

2146
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,002
I was really trying
to get my soul back,

2147
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,087
and it was in his underwear.

You know what?
Why don't you check yourself?

2152
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,895
He was crying.
He missed his mommy.

2153
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,731
Mommy left without saying anything.

2154
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,107
He's okay?

2155
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,150
Yeah, he's fine.

2156
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,735
He's in our bed.

2157

I'm gonna go sleep in my office.

2158
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,031
You don't have to do that.

2159
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:15,365
- It's stupid.
- No, no.

2160
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,118
It's stupid. Nothing happened.
Nothing really--

2161
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,121
MARION, narrating:
In fairy tales, they tell you

2162
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,499
they lived happily ever after.

2163
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,917
They never tell you
the rest of the story

2164
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,752
for a very good reason.

2165
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,838
No more dragons to slay
after the happy ending.

2166
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,465
Life begins,

2167
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:34,343
and that's way harder to handle
than any dragon.

2168

with the most precious gift
in the whole world.

2170
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,228
You know why
I don't believe in the soul?

2171
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,897
Because a soul would
probably mean an afterlife.

2172
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,899
And if there was something,

2173
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:51,485
my mom would have tried
to communicate with me somehow,

even though she knows better
than to contact me
