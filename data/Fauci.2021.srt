1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,203
How are we doin'?

2
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>Starting route
to National Institutes of Health.</i>

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,923
Sorry Cliff, I'm trying... I'm trying
to get the right security

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,134
to get into the right entrance.

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,220
- This is a whole new life here.
<i>- Yeah, I know, I...</i>

6
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,861
<i>It is just before 7:00
in the morning</i>

7
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,822
<i>and Dr. Fauci is beginning
one of his 12-hour days.</i>

8
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>It is a schedule he keeps six days a week.</i>

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,663
Ten seconds. There you go.
It's always ten seconds.

10
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,839
<i>Tony Fauci
has not been elected to anything.</i>

11
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,134
<i>He's had the same job for nearly 40 years.</i>

12
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>That means the majority of American voters
never even indirectly picked him.</i>

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,682
<i>Yet, in the last four months,</i>

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,311
<i>Fauci has become one
of the most powerful people in the world.</i>

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,483
<i>For more on
what we know about the coronavirus,</i>

16
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>we're joined now by Dr. Anthony Fauci.</i>

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>He's Director of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</i>

18
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,199
<i>Dr. Fauci, how concerned should we be?</i>

19
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,867
<i>For a while,</i>

20
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>life is not gonna be the way it used to be
in the United States.</i>

21
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,206
<i>We have to just accept that</i>

22
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>if we wanna do what's best
for the American public.</i>

23
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,506
<i>How does this compare
to anything that you've ever dealt with?</i>

24
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,884
<i>You always almost have
a fog of war about it.</i>

25
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,179
<i>It's not that different
than the very early years</i>

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>of the HIV epidemic.</i>

27
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,308
<i>Fauci is the Director</i>

28
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,103
<i>of the National Institute of Allergies
and Infectious Diseases</i>

29
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,938
<i>and is the Commanding Officer</i>

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,315
<i>in the nation's scientific war
against AIDS.</i>

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>He is also a target of critics who charge
the government's response to AIDS</i>

32
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>- has been one of confusion.</i>

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,366
<i>The only people
in charge of AIDS are incompetent hacks.</i>

34
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,293
I mean, what the hell
are these people doing?

35
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,828
They're not producing drugs.

36
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,081
Fire Fauci! Fire Fauci!

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,749
<i>Do wear a mask,
don't wear a mask.</i>

38
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>Don't worry about the coronavirus.</i>

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>Never reopen schools
until we have a cure for coronavirus.</i>

40
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:59,721
<i>Dr. Fauci has been
at this for 50 years. He is an icon.</i>

41
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,640
<i>He is the most published researcher
in the world.</i>

42
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,728
<i>I think Donald Trump
is the sixth president he has served.</i>

43
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,315
<i>He was very involved
in the early AIDS epidemic, Ebola...</i>

44
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,858
<i>You name it, he's been there.</i>

45
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,652
<i>Did he get ventilators prepared?</i>

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,530
<i>Did he get masks prepared?
Did he get gloves prepared?</i>

47
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,074
<i>No. No, he did nothing.</i>

48
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>He should be fired,
indicted and thrown in jail</i>

49
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,036
<i>and it's time we have a revolution
in this country.</i>

50
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,668
<i>I'd actually like to go back
to the old times of Tudor England.</i>

51
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:36,090
<i>I'd put the heads on pikes
as a warning to federal bureaucrats,</i>

52
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,094
<i>either get with the program
or you're gone.</i>

53
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,937
God help us. God help us!

54
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,189
<i>Hmm.</i>

55
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,827
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, you're good.</i>

56
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,207
So, they're turning down
TB requests for vaccine research?

57
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,501
<i>- Correct.</i>
- Unbelievable.

58
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,254
<i>I asked specifically
"Who said 'no'?"</i>

59
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,508
<i>and it was the White House.
So, I guess we're back at our stalemate.</i>

60
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,971
<i>And, you know, I didn't know
when I pushed back on it,</i>

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>the answer I got was that they want
the focus to be on the economy.</i>

62
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:33,231
I don't get how talking about vaccine
isn't important about the economy.

63
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,775
If you get a vaccine,
the economy will open.

64
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,985
So, what's the problem?

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,736
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I don't... I don't get it.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,789
<i>People are tired
of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,</i>

67
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>all these people,
these people that have gotten it wrong.</i>

68
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,337
<i>Fauci's a disaster.
I mean, this guy, if I listen to him...</i>

69
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,882
<i>Right now,
a lot of people think I'm the bad guy.</i>

70
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,177
<i>Every time he goes
on television there's always a bomb.</i>

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,473
<i>If we listen to him, we have 700,
800,000 deaths right now.</i>

72
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>So if there's a recorder on,
you can have it just the way it's done.</i>

73
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:17,317
<i>I mean, I'm the bad guy
to an entire subset of people...</i>

74
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,737
because I represent something
that is uncomfortable for them.

75
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,155
It's called the truth.

76
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,198
<i>I tell the President exactly...</i>

77
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,468
- I don't doubt that.
<i>- what the scientific data is</i>

78
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,952
<i>and what the evidence is.</i>

79
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,538
Secretary of State Pompeo
is extremely busy.

80
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,915
I'd like him to go back
to the State Department

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,794
or, as they call it,
the Deep State Department. You know, Mike.

82
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,380
I'd like to have him go back
and do his job.

83
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,966
So, does anybody have any questions?

84
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,263
I know I shouldn't be touching
my face, but...

85
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm so good at my job.
How can he be so bad at his?

86
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,786
So the protests don't increase
the spread of the virus?

87
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,896
I didn't say that.
You're putting words in my mouth.

88
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:01,527
Is somebody born a craven partisan hack
or do you become one?

89
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,532
<i>I grew up in Bensonhurst,
which was a somewhat tough neighborhood</i>

90
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>in Brooklyn. You know,
everyone was striving.</i>

91
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,746
<i>Nothing was taken for granted.</i>

92
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,250
There wasn't a lot of head hanging
in those days, you know?

93
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,922
<i>Part of the culture back then
when you were a kid</i>

94
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,217
is that you didn't get intimidated
by a lot of things.

95
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,011
Or, as we used to say,
"You didn't take any shit from anybody."

96
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,388
<i>I don't want to hurt him.</i>

97
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,682
He's been there for about 350 years.
I don't want to hurt him.

98
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,268
<i>Anthony Fauci, this fraud?</i>

99
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,730
<i>This swamp creature?</i>

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>And who is now forced
to go on his power walks</i>

101
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,195
<i>with a security detail,
because he's received death threats.</i>

102
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:50,326
<i>My job is to do whatever I can
to get us out of this outbreak.</i>

103
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,918
My weapon, in addition to the science,
is speaking to the American public.

104
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:07,552
<i>What keeps me grounded
is the enormity of the problem.</i>

105
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:13,141
<i>And just a very deep sense
of responsibility...</i>

106
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,690
that calls for all of the things
that I've been trained for,

107
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,692
dating back to when I was going to school.

108
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:32,577
<i>In high school, I had
this early cultivation of public service.</i>

109
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,333
Regis High School was driven by these guys

110
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,044
in black cassocks called Jesuit Priests.

111
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,215
<i>The Jesuit philosophy is men for others.</i>

112
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>You think about what you can do
for society</i>

113
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
<i>and what you can do for other people.</i>

114
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,558
It's what drove me to go
to medical school.

115
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:04,567
<i>There wasn't a minute that I really
didn't treasure at Cornell Medical School.</i>

116
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>I loved clinical medicine.</i>

117
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,533
<i>Every single cell in my body was,
like, focused in this.</i>

118
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:17,121
<i>It was the first time in my life
that somebody's life is my responsibility.</i>

119
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,670
<i>At the end of my junior year,
it was the Vietnam War.</i>

120
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>And every physician
is automatically drafted.</i>

121
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,892
<i>But you had some choices.
You could do public health service,</i>

122
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,394
<i>Navy, Army or Air Force.</i>

123
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,149
So, I put in public health service first.

124
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,362
Second I put Navy, then Army,
and then Air Force.

125
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,950
<i>And, sure enough, I get a call
from the National Institutes of Health.</i>

126
00:08:55,368 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>The NIH was and is really
the mecca of biomedical research.</i>

127
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,419
<i>Here in the laboratories
at NIH, much of the research is basic.</i>

128
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,132
<i>Clinical medicine is practiced at NIH
because it contributes to research</i>

129
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,511
<i>rather than because of the patient's need
for medical attention.</i>

130
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,180
<i>Virtually everyone</i>

131
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,559
<i>who was anyone in academic medicine
in this country...</i>

132
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,603
<i>had spent some time here.</i>

133
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,567
And it was like entering
into a magical world.

134
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,696
<i>When I first came down,</i>

135
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,823
<i>what I really wanted to do
was do three years,</i>

136
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,199
<i>bingo, and go back to New York</i>

137
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,661
<i>and become the Chief Resident
at the New York Hospital.</i>

138
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:45,668
Back then, that was your ticket
to a private practice on Park Avenue.

139
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,422
<i>You know, I was a kid from Brooklyn</i>

140
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:56,679
and Brooklyn to Manhattan
is like New York State to Rome.

141
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,184
But as I got to learn more about myself,
the idea of discovery,

142
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,229
the idea of having an impact
on a lot more people...

143
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,609
<i>trying to figure out diseases
that people were dying from,</i>

144
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,320
that's what really captured me.

145
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>So, I became the Senior Investigator
at the NIH.</i>

146
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,375
I met Tony very shortly after I came
to the NIH.

147
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>Tony was a Lab Chief at that point
in time.</i>

148
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,971
He was a long-term single guy.
Totally dedicated to work.

149
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,350
He worked more hours
than almost anybody I've ever known.

150
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>My wife and I would sometimes tease Tony.</i>

151
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,649
<i>Because he had several female companions
through the years.</i>

152
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,986
<i>I'd go on a date every once
in a while,</i>

153
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,282
<i>but I was completely buried in my work.</i>

154
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,328
<i>I actually remember very vividly,</i>

155
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>and hearing this
from other people as well,</i>

156
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,416
if you're working
with one of Tony Fauci's patients,

157
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,460
you'd better take good care
of that patient

158
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,962
because he will demand it of you.

159
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,051
All of this discussion of vasculitis
is merely academic.

160
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,260
<i>At the time,</i>

161
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:23,474
I was focused on vasculitis
which is an inflammation of blood vessels

162
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,686
that leads to kidney failure,
lung failure and things like that.

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>There was a patient who was a senator
from Brazil.</i>

164
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>He didn't speak any English and I said,</i>

165
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
<i>"Well, I can't have a conversation
with this guy,</i>

166
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,571
<i>so who speaks Portuguese around here?"</i>

167
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,451
So they called this nurse,
this Christine Grady,

168
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,620
into the room, um...

169
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,582
and she stand by the bedside
and I looked at her, I says, "Wow!"

170
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,794
"Who's this?"

171
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,298
<i>I had just spent two years
in Brazil</i>

172
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,426
and so my Portuguese
was then pretty good.

173
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>And we had this meeting
in the patient's room</i>

174
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,181
and I said, "He would like to go home."

175
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,101
I said, "Okay. That's fine to do that,

176
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,605
"but he's gotta understand,
these ulcers are not completely healed.

177
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,191
"He's gotta keep his legs elevated

178
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,069
and he's gotta change
the dressings frequently."

179
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,406
So, he speaks Portuguese back.

180
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,408
I'm, sort of, sitting there
waiting to hear.

181
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,787
The patient said to me...
"There's no way I'm going to do that.

182
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:32,168
I'm going to go to the beach every day."
He lived on the beach, near the beach.

183
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,046
"And I'm going to go dancing at night.
I've been in the hospital for months

184
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,758
and you expect me to go home
and sit with my leg in the air?"

185
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:43,429
And I, sort of, gulped and thought,
what the heck am I going to do now?

186
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,431
She turned to me and looked at me

187
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,226
and said, "He said he's gonna do exactly
like you said."

188
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,353
I said, "Good. You can go."

189
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>A day later,
I saw Dr. Fauci in the hallway,</i>

190
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,655
who said to me,
"I'd like to see you in my office."

191
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,535
And I was certain that I was caught

192
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,372
and going to be either reprimanded
or fired.

193
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,293
So, she comes into the office
with a great deal of trepidation.

194
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,172
She sits down and I look at her and I say,

195
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,341
"Would you like to go to dinner?"

196
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
So, that was the beginning.

197
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,398
<i>When we got to know each other
really well, she says,</i>

198
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,277
"You know, remember that conversation
that we had in the room?

199
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,948
Well, I actually told you a white lie."

200
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,163
<i>I think Tony came
to the NIH young and ambitious</i>

201
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,750
and looking for a challenge, I think,
and found it.

202
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:10,057
<i>I was sitting in my office
and I saw this... article...</i>

203
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,645
<i>in a publication called </i>MMWR.

204
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:21,360
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
<i>And it reported five men...</i>

205
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:28,325
curiously all gay men, who developed
a very strange pneumonia

206
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,578
called pneumocystis pneumonia.

207
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,790
And, being a busy young investigator
at the time,

208
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:39,295
I took it, I put it in my desk
and I said, "This must be a fluke.

209
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,713
It's gonna go away."

210
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>One month later, another </i>MMWR <i>appears.</i>

211
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,349
<i>This time, 26 gay men...</i>

212
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,437
who not only had pneumocystis pneumonia,

213
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,817
but had Kaposi's sarcoma,
a tumor, a cancer,

214
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,947
seen in people whose immune system
is remarkably suppressed.

215
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,453
And I remember looking at that
and going, "Oh, my God.

216
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,123
"There's no way that this is a fluke.

217
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,335
This is a brand new disease."

218
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>I actually got goosebumps.</i>

219
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,636
So, I made a decision
that I was going to completely change

220
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,179
the direction of my research.

221
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,894
<i>He had lots of critics
on the NIH campus.</i>

222
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,942
They thought he was making a mistake.
That he was taking on a disease

223
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,486
in an area of science
that was going nowhere

224
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,197
and that he was gonna ruin
his career basically.

225
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,576
<i>So, I wrote an article
in 1981...</i>

226
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>saying that if we think this disease
is gonna stay confined</i>

227
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,544
<i>to a very discreet group of people,</i>

228
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,048
<i>that it's not gonna explode,
we're kidding ourselves.</i>

229
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,384
I submitted it to a major journal.

230
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,262
They rejected it
because one of the reviewers said

231
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,014
I was being too alarmist.

232
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,269
<i>So right away, he had
to fight... Not fight but push back on,</i>

233
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,236
<i>you know, people who said,
"But wait a minute,</i>

234
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:25,567
you can't put money into this
and take it away from other things."

235
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,194
And he said, "But we have to,

236
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,196
because we have to learn
about this disease."

237
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,574
<i>I recruited young people
to work with me.</i>

238
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>Henry Masur, who was
on the junior faculty at Cornell,</i>

239
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,707
<i>Cliff Lane had just finished
his fellowship</i>

240
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:45,337
<i>and the three of us
became the Three Musketeers of HIV</i>

241
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,588
<i>here at NIH.</i>

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,011
Our focus at the time was
the adult human immune system.

243
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,763
There weren't a lot of groups
that had that as a focus.

244
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,057
You just knew you had to do something.

245
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,904
Because you thought
you could do something.

246
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Scientists
at the National Center For Disease Control</i>

247
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>in Atlanta today released the results
of a study</i>

248
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,240
which shows that the lifestyle
of some male homosexuals

249
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,493
has triggered an epidemic
of a rare form of cancer.

250
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,246
<i>Researchers know of 413 people</i>

251

<i>who have contracted the condition

<i>One third have died
and none have been cured.</i>

253
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,837
How many friends have you lost
to this disease?

254
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,005
Twenty.

255
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,173
- Twenty?
- Yes.

256
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,383
And you have
still more friends who are sick?

257
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,509
Very ill.

258
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,180
Jane, can you imagine what it must be like
if you had lost 20 of your friends

259
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,307
- in the last 18 months?
- No.

260
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,061
- And you don't know why?
- No cause, no cure.

261
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,063
<i>Investigators
have examined the habits</i>

262

<i>of homosexuals for clues.</i>

263
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,526

A-I-D-S. AIDS.

266

The most frightening initials
in America today.

267
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>A medical mystery that destroys
the immune system</i>

268
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:03,123
<i>and leaves our bodies defenseless
against unusual and deadly infections.</i>

269
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,794
<i>I was going out
and meeting people,</i>

270
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,961
<i>trying to find a lover.</i>

271
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,798
I didn't know that, you know,
that there were things out there

272
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,551
so secretly hidden
that it was gonna destroy my life.

273
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,769
<i>I had been trained
as an infectious disease doc...</i>

<i>and as an immunologist.</i>

275
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,983
If ever there was a disease
that I was made for...

276
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,194
it's this disease.

277
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,990
<i>Dr. Fauci, can you tell us
what do we know?</i>

278
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,468
<i>What are the best clues you've got?</i>

279
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>We do have some clues
that it may be a viral agent</i>

280
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,915
that is likely infecting immune cells
that are necessary to fight

281
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,291
certain types of infections...

282
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:52,256
We didn't know what it was.
We strongly suspected it was a virus.

283
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:57,678
There is, right now at the present time,
no known cure for AIDS.

284
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,390
We don't even know what the agent is,
much less how to cure it.

<i>Like ink spreading on a blotter,</i>

<i>For the first time North America,</i>

once you get the underlying immune defect,

296
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,512
you do not recover from it,
which is a very, very important thing.

297
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
<i>A small army of dedicated medical warriors</i>

298
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,142
<i>is trying to combat this killer.</i>

299
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>In the laboratories,
researchers are scrambling for a cure.</i>

300
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>In the hospitals and doctors' offices,</i>

301
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,901
<i>the front line soldiers
face a losing battle</i>

302
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>and must content themselves
with the little victories for now.</i>

303
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,033
<i>You know, every once in a while
when you're involved</i>

304
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,160
<i>in a difficult situation you get bad news,</i>

305
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,288
bad news and then sometimes
encouraging news comes along

306
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,557
to make you feel a little better.

307
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,584
It was all bad, bad, worse,
bad, worse, bad, worse.

308
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,341
<i>It was just so unbelievably... frustrating</i>

309
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,887
when you're used to...
being able to fix things

310
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,057
and you're just not really fixing
anything.

311
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>It is very difficult to work
with young people who you care for,</i>

312
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,775
become quite attached to
and in some cases even identify with

313
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,820
and to watch them overtime
get sicker and die.

314
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,867
It is not just one patient,
but one after another after another.

315
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:48,705
And I had had jobs prior to this one
where people were very sick

316
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:53,502
and many of my patients had died,
but this was different...

317
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,800
because everybody was, sort of,
at the prime of their life.

318
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,140
Back then, when you got sick
you were gone fast.

319
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,186
Seven, eight, nine months
and it was horrible deaths.

320
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,526
It was a time when all of us
were very scared

321
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,862
and there was very little
that we could do.

322
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:28,453
I found out in late '85, November 1985...

323
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,414
<i>I was 24.</i>

324
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,458
<i>I didn't know anything
about the politics of AIDS.</i>

325
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,337
<i>I just knew that it was all of a sudden
this terrible scare story</i>

326
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,134
and the country was in a panic about it
and that it was 100 percent fatal.

327
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,887
<i>I was living in the Bronx</i>

328
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:51,268
<i>with my lover Jeff, who was diagnosed
with Kaposi's sarcoma.</i>

329
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,355
For me, the AIDS epidemic started then.

330
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,610
<i>I went to my doctor
and the minute he put the needle in my arm</i>

331
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,281
I knew I was positive, I knew it.
And then I avoided his calls.

332
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,784
For three and a half weeks,
I was able to avoid his calls...

333
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,414
and then he found me and he said
that I was HIV positive.

334
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,043
I said, "Well, what's the prognosis or..."

335
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,628
He said, "18 months."

336
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,215
Breathe in and out with your mouth open.

337
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,887
<i>You know, one of my patients
who had cytomegalovirus retinitis.</i>

338
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,141
<i>Cytomegalovirus is a virus
that chews up the retina.</i>

339
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,270
<i>And he was gradually losing vision.</i>

340
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,648
He would walk in, he'd say,
"Dr. Fauci, how are you?"

341
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,609
He was always upbeat. He'd walk in.

342
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,861
I would smile. You know,
he'd make comments,

343
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,030
"I love your smile.
You have a great smile."

344
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,158
And I'd go in every day and morning,
afternoon, evening

345
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,160
and then, one day,

346
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,081
we walked in in the morning
and I walked in and went up to the desk

347
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,041
and he said, "Who's there?"

348
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:01,797
And it was clear, you know,
that he gone completely blind.

349
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,590
And it was like...

350
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:08,845
And we were standing around the bed
saying, "Now what?" you know?

351
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,432
And it was... it was terrible,
because he lost his vision completely.

352
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,975
Yeah.

353
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,685
It's affecting you now.

354
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,479
- Yeah.
- Why?

355
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,202
Uh,
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

356
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,546
That's what it is.

357
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,225
<i>My early understanding
of what my dad was doing was...</i>

358
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,353
there's something happening
that's affecting people,

359
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,272
that's hurting people,
that's killing people.

360
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,902
<i>When I think about my dad growing up,
I certainly think about that seriousness,</i>

361
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:10,365
that intensity and working hard
and wanting to do the right thing.

362
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,117
<i>That's his compass.</i>

363
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:18,415
<i>At the same time, I also think
about a person that I think</i>

364
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,750
very few people get to see.

365
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,629
<i>Which is someone who is funny</i>

366
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,424
and weird and really playful.

367
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,220
This is a record
for the month of July, 1988.

368
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,598
We've been over 100,
so how many days in a row?

369
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,308
- Several.
- Too many.

370
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,187
Well, we're just sitting here
hanging out by the pool on a Sunday...

371
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,939
Sunday morning.

372
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,151
Jenny and Daddy are gonna go swimming!

373
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,920
Are you gonna go swimming?
Are you gonna show everybody

374
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,779
how you could stay up straight
in the water?

375
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,408
- Show Mommy.
- Come on.

376
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,412
Yeah. You've got water in your eye?

377
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:03,376
<i>When Chris and I were knee deep
in responding to this historic pandemic.</i>

378
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,756
<i>We wanted to and did raise a family.</i>

379
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,966
- Now you've got us all?
- Yeah.

380
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,551
Okay, Nan.

381
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,970
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

382
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,432
Here's Jenny and her baby sister.
Jennifer, Mommy, and Daddy.

383
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,100
Jennifer and her baby sister Megan.

384
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,352
Hi, Megan.

385
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,288
- Oh, don't you look pretty!
- Look, it's coming off.

386
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:27,400
It's March 30th, 1989...

387
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,487
and Megan is getting herself a bath.

388
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,157
<i>Jenny first and Megan,
then Alison.</i>

389
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,535
- Hi, Momma.
- Are you the audience with me?

390
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,661
Yes.

391
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,788
Merry Christmas.

392
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,374
Whoa, don't fall!

393
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,628
January seventh, the blizzard of 1996.

394
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,714
Probably the largest snow storm
in the history of Washington, D.C...

395
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,301
A foot. It's a foot
and it's gonna be two feet.

396
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,807
When our children were little,
he used to work all the time.

397
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,561
And there were times
when they wouldn't see him

398
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,604
for a couple of days sometimes.

399
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,525
<i>I wouldn't say I neglected
the raising of the children,</i>

400
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,780
but I did not sacrifice
professional things...

401
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,324
as much as maybe I should have.

402
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,871
<i>I was not going
to every soccer match,</i>

403
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>every track meet, every swim meet.</i>

404
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,587
- Yes.
- Whoo! Yeah.

405
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,548
<i>Chris did everything.</i>

406
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>But we did something that I think
physically is a little unhealthy,</i>

407
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,224
I don't recommend it for people,
but it worked.

408
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,977
We decided that
we were gonna have dinner...

409
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,149
together every night
no matter how late the dinner was.

410
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,405
<i>He would come home
from like a 12 or 13-hour day of work</i>

411
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,117
and he would come in the kitchen
and start dancing with my mom.

412
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,872
I'm like, "Dad, we want to eat dinner.
Please come and sit down."

413
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:10,712
But we understood that when he's working,
which is all of the time,

414
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,340
he's laser focused.

415
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,012
<i>Rather than name
each and every one of these,</i>

416
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,306
why don't I just talk
about asthma analogy,

417
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,977
I'll mention transportation, autoimmunity,
vaccine developments, skip cancer,

418
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,302
go to immune mediated disease
and then end up with AIDS.

419
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,400
<i>AIDS brings a new level
of pressure and public attention to NIH,</i>

420
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,569
<i>and especially to Dr. Fauci,</i>

421
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,031
<i>who already manages
three full time jobs at NIH.</i>

422
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,451
<i>Administrator, physician,
research scientist.</i>

423
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,162
Pardon my eating,
I'm having my lunch before the hearing,

424
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,665
so if I'm eating in your ear,
don't worry.

425
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,250
We don't have the answer.
We're trying to get the answer,

426
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,796
but we're letting the science take us
where it's taking us.

427
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,648
Researchers believe that they have made

428
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,300
a monumental breakthrough
in the fight against AIDS.

429
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,512
The deadly disease that attacks
the body's immune system.

430
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,098
US Government scientists announced
in Washington today,

431
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,184
they have isolated a virus
they believe causes AIDS.

432
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,354
<i>The breakthrough came
at the National Institutes of Health,</i>

433
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,107
<i>where a way was found
to mass produce the AIDS virus,</i>

434
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,735
<i>study it and most importantly,
to test blood for it.</i>

435
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,655
- Fauci?
- F-A-U-C-I.

436
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>We found that we had a virus.
It was really quite transforming.</i>

437
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,829
Now I have it in my hand,
I know what the hell it is.

438
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,624
You know, I have it in a test tube.
It's not like this thing

439
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,868
that's floating around
that we have no idea what it is.

440
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:48,518
There is an inherent fear...
built into viruses.

441
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,104
<i>The lives of millions of Americans</i>

442
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,441
<i>are being severely disrupted
by the coronavirus pandemic.</i>

443
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,945
<i>Schools, work, even iconic institutions
like Broadway and Disneyworld</i>

444
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,905
<i>are shut down. Experts say...</i>

445
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,242
When we hear about one
that is taking off...

446
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,287
it really rings all of the alarm bells.

447
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,291
<i>Seeing a vibrant city
like New York</i>

448
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:17,005
resembling a bit of a ghost town
was a moving... feeling for me.

449
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,923
Very emotional...

450
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,927
<i>because, you know, I grew up as a kid
roaming around Manhattan.</i>

451
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,097
<i>And to see it empty
was just very, very shocking</i>

452
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
<i>in many respects.</i>

453
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>But community spread was rampant</i>

454
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,563
<i>and we had to make a decision
to shut everything down.</i>

455
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,774
<i>The tri-state region now topping</i>

456
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:40,820
<i>90,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19
and more than 1,500 deaths.</i>

457
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,698
<i>Hospitals are reeling
with New York City's mayor,</i>

458
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,659
<i>warning they will run out of supplies
by this weekend.</i>

459
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,498
Okay. VRC.

460
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,874
Sure.

461
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
<i>As soon as we heard</i>

462
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,675
<i>that in Wuhan these cases
apparently appeared,</i>

463
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,262
we had no idea
if it was gonna turn out to be bad.

464
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:10,892
We just knew it is conceivable
that this could turn out to be a pandemic.

465
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,438
<i>My group here
in the Vaccine Research Center said...</i>

466
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,318
"As soon as we get a sequence,
let's go for it."

467
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,404
<i>The sequence came out,
I believe, on the ninth.</i>

468
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,050
<i>We had the meeting on the tenth.
By the time we got to the 15th,</i>

469
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,284
we were already in the process
of making it

470
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,247
and then 63, 65 days later,
we were in a phase one trial.

471
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:36,626
Scientists all across the world
are now racing to find a vaccine

472
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,254
that can help combat
the coronavirus in the future.

473
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,089
<i>The National Institutes of Health</i>

474
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,799
<i>and a Massachusetts company Moderna</i>

475
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,260
<i>are behind the record speed
clinical trials.</i>

476
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,554
We've been hearing a lot
about the Moderna vaccine,

477
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,055
that's an mRNA vaccine.

478
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,807
<i>This is different from other vaccines.</i>

479
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,018
<i>It uses mRNA to basically teach the body
how to fight the virus.</i>

480
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,355
<i>But never before have we seen
a successful mRNA vaccine.</i>

481
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,983
When we were confronted with this virus,

482
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,153
there are a lot of very smart people
at the NIH who put their heads together

483
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,157
and realized that mRNA vaccines
could be a real option.

484
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,995
<i>If it works,
it's a potentially safer and faster path.</i>

485
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>Shortening the development process
from decades to years.</i>

486
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,627
Even though we didn't all know about it,
there was a lot of research being done

487
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:24,090
<i>for many, many years with the NIH
towards making mRNA vaccines.</i>

488
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,968
- I think it's gonna work.
- I do too.

489
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,219
I mean, I really do.

490
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,349
We had been priming
the pump for years before

491
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,936
with the platform technology,
in this case mRNA.

492
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,232
<i>So, as soon as we found out that we were
dealing with a brand new virus,</i>

493
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,988
we said, "This what we do.
We make vaccines. Let's do it."

494
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,575
This is a very exciting technology
at the mRNA vaccines

495
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,118
and it's extremely exciting,

496
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,787
but I don't believe a single one of them
has ever reached market.

497
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
<i>It's incredibly impressive</i>

498
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>that they made that call,
because it's a bold one.</i>

499
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,382
It took some amount of courage
to move forward with something

500
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,551
that you know isn't an absolute certainty.

501
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,720
I talked to Tony Fauci yesterday,

502
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,449
the Head of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

503
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,309
A vaccine is in the works,
but it's a couple of years away.

504
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,729
The fastest we had ever developed
a vaccine before that was for mumps

505
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,855
and that took four years.

506
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,732
And so, we're able to move
very, very fast,

507
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,235
so as soon as we get the phase one dose
out of the NIH,

508
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,247
we'll be able to start phase two
right away.

509
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,216
You're talking over the next few months
you think you could have a vaccine?

510
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,992
- Correct.
- With phase two.

511
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,330
Yeah. You won't have a vaccine.
You'll have a vaccine to go into testing.

512
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,581
Testing, yes.

513
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,418
Well, you have the greatest companies
in the world sitting around the table.

514
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,838
I mean, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer
and all of the companies. Gilead.

515
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,217
Uh, you have all of these great companies
and that's what they're saying,

516
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,802
so I think that...

517
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,846
Would you make sure you get
the President the information

518
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,850
that a vaccine that you make
and start testing in a year

519
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,811
is not a vaccine that's deployable.

520
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,481
So, he's asking the question
"When is it gonna be deployable?"

521
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,610
and that is gonna be, at the earliest,
a year to a year and half,

522
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,320
no matter how fast you go.

523
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,408
I met with the President and with Tony
and a few others in the room

524
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,575
on a couple of occasions.

525
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,789
<i>Oftentimes it was Tony
who was seen as the main proponent</i>

526
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,374
<i>of the unpopular view.</i>

527
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,211
You take a solid flu vaccine,
you don't think that would have an impact

528
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,171
or much of an impact on corona?

529
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,923
No, no. Probably not.

530
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,177
Can you talk
about your early meetings

531
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,347
with the President
and your impressions of him?

532
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,437
Is that something
that you're willing to share?

533
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,809
Yikes!

534
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,022
How deep do you want to get?

535
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,699
<i>We had task force meetings
very regularly.</i>

536
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:58,619
First, a few times a week and then,
almost literally every single day.

537
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,207
<i>We're live now
at the White House in the briefing room,</i>

538
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,085
<i>where moments from now President Trump
will hold a news conference</i>

539
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,504
<i>talking about
his administration's response</i>

540
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,506
<i>to the coronavirus outbreak.</i>

541
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,805
<i>We had press conferences
that were a hybrid of a press conference.</i>

542
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,017
<i>It wasn't totally dominated
by the scientists.</i>

543
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,685
Thank you very much.

544
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,229
<i>The President would get up
with his style</i>

545
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,484
and... for reasons that none of us
could understand,

546
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,029
it was always confronting the press.

547
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,449
What do you say to Americans
who are watching right now who are scared?

548
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,453
I say that you're a terrible reporter.
That's what I say. Go ahead.

549
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,789
<i>Because of that,
the public health messages</i>

550
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,582
<i>got a bit muddled.</i>

551
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,961
The President might get up,
and out of nowhere, say something

552
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,881
that we would all go,
"What's that all about?"

553
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,634
<i>President Trump's
been touting an anti-malaria drug</i>

554
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,719
that he says
could help treat the coronavirus.

555
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,055
So, how beneficial is hydroxychloroquine?

556
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,725
My next guest says doctors
are already using this treatment

557
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,519
in the United States successfully.

558
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:09,023
For me, I'm absolutely convinced
this is what saved my life.

559
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,819
It was the typical example
that we scientists shudder at.

560
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:18,366
Joe Jones tells you that I did this
and I got better, therefore, it works.

561
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,537
And it was very clear
that there was no evidence whatsoever

562
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,623
that hydroxychloroquine... worked.

563
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,043
And that's when things got complicated.

564
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,210
Yes, John.

565
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,047
A question
for Dr. Fauci, if I could.

566
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,717
Dr. Fauci, it was explained yesterday
there has been some promise

567
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,344
with hydroxychloroquine,

568
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,806
this potential therapy for people
who are infected with coronavirus.

569
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,518
Is there any evidence to suggest
that, as with malaria,

570
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,104
it might be used as a prophylaxis
against COVID-19?

571
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,650
No. The answer is no and the evidence
that you're talking about, John,

572
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,235
is anecdotal evidence.

573
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,114
That was the first time that publicly,
with all the cameras rolling,

574
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,326
I just had to get up and contradict him.

575
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,538
But the information
that you are referring to specifically

576
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,833
is anecdotal. It was not done
in a controlled clinical trial,

577
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,377
so you really can't make
any definitive statement about it.

578
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>When I stepped back
from the podium,</i>

579
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:21,387
I remembered the advice that I got
decades earlier by my good friend

580
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,809
who said, "Whenever you go
into the White House, you should assume

581
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,104
"that there's a possibility
that you're not gonna get asked back,

582
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,066
because you might have to tell somebody
something they didn't want to hear."

583
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,820
And as I stepped back I said,
"Well, this may be it."

584
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,994
I think...
without saying too much,

585
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,458
I'm probably more of a fan of that
than... maybe than anybody.

586
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,921
He was so much in his own world
that... I don't...

587
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,924
He didn't react in a way of saying

588
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,259
how dare you contradict me
I'm the President?

589
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,224
It was like, I'll say what I'm gonna say,
you say what you're gonna say.

590
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,682
Let's see if it works.
It might and it might not.

591
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,393
I happen to feel good about it,
but who knows?

592
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,104
I've been right a lot.
Let's see what happens.

593
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,624
- John.
- Can I come back to the science

594
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,375
- and the logistics?
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

595
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,944
<i>The units that were ordered,
are they for...</i>

596
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,824
<i>It just was
a remarkable sort of back and forth</i>

597
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,661
between someone who's using
their gut instincts,

598
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,247
not scientifically based,
not evidence based

599
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,208
against, you know,
a venerable scientist who kept

600
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,671
sort of, on the fly, it seems,
trying to fact check the President.

601
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,550
<i>I just had never seen anything like it.</i>

602
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,388
<i>I think Tony Fauci probably has one
of the hardest jobs in America right now.</i>

603
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:55,106
Communication is not ancillary
to fighting an epidemic.

604
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,150
Communication is central
to fighting an epidemic.

605
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:02,697
I'd like to provide some basic
but important facts about Ebola

606
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,115
and its transmission.

607
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,076
<i>During the crises
that we faced in the Obama Administration,</i>

608
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,914
it was particularly Dr. Fauci
who brought this extraordinary sobriety...

609
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:18,087
and rationality and fact based,
evidence based leadership to the table.

610
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,264
<i>The Centers for Disease Control</i>

611
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,143
<i>is closely monitoring what's become
the largest Ebola outbreak in history.</i>

612
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,187
<i>Ebola has been
ravaging West Africa since March</i>

613
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,524
<i>and shocked disease specialists
when it hopped a border by plane.</i>

614
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,279
<i>The moment Ebola
began spreading in cities,</i>

615
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,740
we were at the edge of an abyss.

616
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,242
<i>From the front lines
of West Africa</i>

617
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,621
<i>to the front door of America,
an all-out push to get ahead of Ebola.</i>

618
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,374
I think we've got to let
the science guide us.

619
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,461
<i>The outbreak
that the President said</i>

620
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,838
<i>was unlikely to come here is now here.</i>

621
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:07,887
<i>Our nation
was really wired into a frenzy of anxiety</i>

622
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,890
about whether this
is gonna sweep across the country

623
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,433
and take us all with it.

624
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,228
Right now we have a devastating epidemic
in West Africa

625
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,731
and we're having an epidemic of fear
in the United States,

626
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,192
so we've got to continue to try
and educate people

627
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,986
about what they need to
or do not need to be afraid of.

628
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:28,783
Dr. Fauci clearly understood
and clearly conveyed

629
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,578
that there was a wise,
scientifically driven way

630
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,498
to deal with this and a hysterical way
to deal with it.

631
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,251
The reason we are having
this very difficult situation

632
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,003
in the African countries

633
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:45,132
is because they don't have the system
to be able to contain it.

634
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,052
If they had the system,
we would not be seeing

635
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,054
all of this suffering and dying
in West Africa.

636
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,599
If that's the case and if it's one case
in the United States now,

637
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,725
as we know it is...

638
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,561
why are we having
news conferences like this

639
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:58,979
and why are we all so afraid?

640
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,941
<i>Ebola is a terrifying virus.</i>

641
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,611
<i>It causes you to bleed
through your orifices.</i>

642
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,824
<i>It's transmissible through bodily fluids.</i>

643
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:15,287
It's not, therefore as easy to catch
as a COVID-19 or a flu virus

644
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,705
because it's not airborne.

645
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,166
<i>But it is much more deadly.</i>

646
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,632
The American part of dealing
with Ebola here in this country

647
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,301
took basically a 90 degree turn
this weekend.

648
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,721
<i>A nurse in Dallas
becomes the first person</i>

649
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,599
<i>to contract Ebola in the United States.</i>

650
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:40,271
Just moments ago, Nurse Nina Pham
left the city for an NIH facility.

651
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,481
<i>I believe that it's Nina Pham.</i>

652
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,859
<i>It looks like
she's walking off the plane there, Don.</i>

653
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,445
<i>- Yeah, very slowly.</i>
- When we were called upon...

654
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,116
to care for one of the nurses
who got infected, Tony led that charge.

655
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,412
She came here at 11:54.
All of us have been up all night.

656
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,456
We haven't learned a lot
about the virus yet.

657
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,082
We're taking care of the patient.

658
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,419
<i>Even some of our staff
and our community</i>

659
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,631
were a little reluctant
to go near the doctors and the nurses

660
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,302
who were taking care of Ebola patients
because they thought

661
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,762
we were going to infect people
in the community,

662
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,056
which was impossible.
That was not gonna happen.

663
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,060
<i>So, when Nina completely recovered,</i>

664
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,730
<i>we decided
we would publicly discharge her.</i>

665
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,358
<i>As we were waiting in the lobby,
I was saying,</i>

666
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:31,822
"Maybe I should do something here
that could change around the stigma."

667
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,368
Our patient Nina Pham is free of Ebola.

668
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,578
Nina?

669
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,919
<i>I wanted people to see</i>

670
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:50,174
that I was not afraid of hugging someone
who was completely recovered.

671
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,553
<i>I mean, it was, like, click, click,
click, click all over the place.</i>

672
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,514
- We love you, Nina.
- Yeah.

673
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,352
<i>To be able to turn
that around and say,</i>

674
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,313
"Here's somebody who had it
and she's fine,"

675
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,984
it's a counter to that visceral fear
of contagion.

676
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,532
<i>Tony has an ability
to deal with fear</i>

677
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,201
<i>and a really serious understanding</i>

678
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,914
of how to speak about... uncertainty

679
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:27,545
and threat...
to a terrified general population.

680
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,427
The AIDS problem in America
is only getting worse

681
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,471
with every passing day
and there is no sign

682
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,181
that it will get better any time soon.

683
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,600
<i>The National Academy of Sciences</i>

684
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,477
<i>is warning of an AIDS catastrophe</i>

685
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,147
<i>unless the government is willing to spend
big money for education and research.</i>

686
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,902
Had this disease afflicted children
or members of the chamber of commerce,

687
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,714
I'm sure the Reagan Administration
would have been breaking down

688
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,448
all doors in order to deal with it.

689
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,953
As the numbers increase,
so does something else. Fear.

690
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,621
The AIDS hotline.

691
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,331
<i>Most of the callers besieging</i>

692
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,376
<i>the country's AIDS hotlines
are heterosexuals,</i>

693
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,963
<i>panicked at the realization
that they too could be at risk.</i>

694
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,302
I personally will tell my child
if someone has AIDS, stay away from them.

695
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,679
<i>At the time,</i>

696
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,099
<i>people were very concerned
about transmission.</i>

697
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,353
We knew how this was transmitted,
but there was still this crazy stigma.

698
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,567
<i>Even though I was a researcher
and a physician scientist,</i>

699
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>I really wanted to get out
and address that.</i>

700
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,489
<i>One of the nation's
outstanding researchers on AIDS</i>

701
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,241
<i>is Dr. Anthony Fauci.</i>

702
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,744
Dr. Fauci, thank you very much
for coming in today.

703
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,247
Anthony Fauci, MD,
National Institute of Health,

704
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,916
make us feel better
about these anxieties.

705
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,339
It appears that the transmissibility
of AIDS is through repeated sexual contact

706
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,508
and/or in IV drug users
in sharing needles.

707
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,846
There is absolutely no evidence at all
that AIDS can be transmitted

708
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,974
by casual contact, by touching,

709
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,478
by any kind of normal social interactions
that you might have with anyone.

710
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,482
So, I think that the fears
may be understandable,

711
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,525
but they're not scientifically sound.

712
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,904
<i>One of the issues
I had to push back against</i>

713
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,948
is that this was kind
of somebody else's disease.

714
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,076
Do you think
that maybe the guilt

715
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,453
that the gay community
has been dealing with

716
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,122
could be a reason
for the breakdown of the immune system?

717
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,331
No.

718
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:32,044
What is your response to those who say
only a small, unsavory group of people

719
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,253
is affected by it?

720
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,441
Therefore, it is not something that those
who lead the straight and narrow life

721
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,050
should be as concerned about there.

722
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,386
To say because someone has
a particular lifestyle

723
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,055
that they're unsavory,
I think is objectionable.

724
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,641
These individuals who are infected,

725
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,394
be they homosexuals
or IV drug abusers, are people.

726
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,731
People who deserve compassion,
who deserve care and who deserve concern.

727
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,568
We need to distinguish
between unfair discrimination

728
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,029
- and fair discrimination.
- Oh!

729
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:03,617
And they are reservoir
of a host of contagious diseases.

730
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,137
I'm gonna have to remove the mic
and we'll move on down this way.

731
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,881
In the light
of that extraordinary outburst,

732
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,832
I think, from a scientific standpoint,

733
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,418
it should be really established
so that everybody understands

734
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,212
that there's nothing intrinsic
about homosexuality

735
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:19,466
that has to do with AIDS,
and her response was a very good example

736
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,751
of the kind of discrimination
that we're talking about.

737
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,389
<i>There's only one source
of the AIDS plague,</i>

738
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,475
the homosexual community
is committing genocide

739
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,936
and we are not speaking
and telling the truth to them.

740
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:35,232
<i>There's religious groups claiming
this is God's revenge</i>

741
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:40,195
and HIV gave them the excuse
to increase their level of hatred

742
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,822
and their level of discrimination.

743
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,907
Some people have been evicted
from their homes,

744
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,368
either by their roommates
or by their landlords,

745
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,579
because of people's fear
of contamination

746
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,456
through their kind of casual
social contact.

747
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,418
<i>If one is against
the reservoir of the disease,</i>

748
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,171
<i>then he's got to be against the reservoir
of the disease,</i>

749
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,675
whether it's cows or monkeys
or homosexuals.

750
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,803
The risk for AIDS
is not being a homosexual man

751
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,806
and the risk for AIDS
is not any of the other groups.

752
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,018
The risk is the behavior.
That's a very important thing.

753
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,230
<i>It was an important experience,
because it got me</i>

754
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,485
<i>to see beyond the individual patient...</i>

755
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,238
<i>beyond the research
and development of the drugs...</i>

756
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,533
what this disease was doing in society.

757
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,622
<i>With some 40,000 reported cases</i>

758
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,918
and 20,000 dead or dying,
AIDS remains the gay plague.

759
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,545
There's some similarities
with this pandemic

760
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,883
in the sense that people naturally want
to look for someone to blame.

761
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,135
<i>We had the greatest year</i>

762
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,971
<i>and then, we got hit
with the China plague, right?</i>

763
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,765
We got hit with the China plague.

764
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:56,104
China has put 40,000,000 Americans out
of work and killed 100,000 Americans.

765
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,984
It's really convenient for politicians
to have a scapegoat like that,

766
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,405
because if they can blame another country,
if they can blame another group of people,

767
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,200
then they can absolve themselves
of responsibility.

768
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,295
<i>Tensions over when
and how fast to reopen</i>

769
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:26,093
<i>dominate American life. States and cities
weigh two overriding factors.</i>

770
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,344
<i>Economic devastation</i>

771
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,306
<i>and nearly 84,000 deaths
in the United States.</i>

772
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,770
When you pull back
and the virus is doing this,

773
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,607
it's only gonna do that.
It's not gonna turn around and come down.

774
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,070
<i>Some people may think
it's gonna be like a light switch,</i>

775
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,823
<i>on and off. You know,
we're either out and we're in.</i>

776
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,395
It's just not gonna be that way.

777
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,287
<i>I don't think you're the end-all,</i>

778
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,930
<i>I don't think you're the one person
that gets to make a decision.</i>

779
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,709
<i>We can listen to your advice,
but there are people on the other side</i>

780
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,312
<i>saying there's not going to be a surge</i>

781
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,672
and that we can safely open the economy
and the facts will bear this out.

782
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,175
<i>I have never made myself out
to be the end all and only voice of this.</i>

783
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,721
I'm a scientist, a physician
and a public health official.

784
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,182
I give advice according
to the best scientific evidence.

785
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,939
This phenomena of just telling the truth,
you know,

786
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:26,486
has made him both, an enemy
and a rock star, you know, all at once.

787
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,198
I want people to know
who they're getting in Tony Fauci.

788
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,245
<i>The head and the heart that comes together
in your body is the real deal.</i>

789
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,916
You're on socks, you're on mugs.
There's Fauci Friday.

790
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,837
Yeah, the National Institutes of hotness!
Just try to stay six feet away.

791
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,007
<i>The man is out there fighting
to keep people healthy</i>

792
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,261
and everyone is just, like,
"Drop you pants. Show us that PhD."

793
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,933
<i>It's been totally surreal
to walk past a bookstore</i>

794
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,853
<i>in my neighborhood and see,
like, a candle with my dad's face on it.</i>

795
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,482
It's like, I don't know
that that will ever feel...

796
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:08,528
um, not totally disorienting
and strange.

797
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,074
<i>Excuse me, don't go outside
without your mask.</i>

798
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,786
<i>Called it Fauci Spring
and people kinda freaked out</i>

799
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:16,912
about this one.

800
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,374
I've just found him very honest,
trustworthy. Kind of like a super hero.

801
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,295
It's amusing, it's interesting,
but you can't take it seriously,

802
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,259
because then you'll start thinking
that you're something that you're not.

803
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,097
However, built into that...
are some fun things.

804
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,016
<i>We welcome Dr. Anthony Fauci.</i>

805
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,105
<i>Fauci's throw was just a bit outside.</i>

806
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,440
Unfortunately, it turns out the man,
like all of us,

807
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,566
has a flaw.

808
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,361
<i>There's a campaign to make you</i>

809
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,280
<i>the </i>People Magazine
<i>Sexiest Man of the Year.</i>

810
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,366
<i>- Why is this happening?</i>

811
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:59,287
<i>I have become "a symbol
for something that isn't really me."</i>

812
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,707
<i>It's something that has been created.</i>

813
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,626
Which, I'm fine with that,
as long as it helps people.

814
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,588
But they need to realize
that when the world gets back to normal,

815
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,676
for sure, I am not the sexiest man
in the world.

816
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,762
<i>In the US, before this pandemic,</i>

817
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:20,058
if you pushed someone to name a scientist,
I bet they couldn't have.

818
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,352
<i>And now they can say Tony Fauci.</i>

819
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:28,942
<i>But, along with all of this attention
and fame came the criticism.</i>

820
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,570
<i>Anthony Fauci is doing blogs,</i>

821
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,238
<i>he's doing Steph Curry's podcasts.</i>

822
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,741
Can't he get on a lab coat
and make some progress?

823
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,618
He's running for something.
Does anybody know what?

824
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,079
Because, above all,
you must never mock

825
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,998
the sainted Anthony Fauci.

826
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,335
Tony's been criticized for a lot of things
during this pandemic.

827
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,297
Some of those he deserves,
like the mask guidance.

828
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,049
I think that was confusing for people.

829
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,342
In March, Fauci told <i>60 Minutes</i>

830
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,928
there's no reason
to be walking around with a mask.

831
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,972
Well, there was.

832
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,351
He felt he was going by the best
of what science offered at the time

833
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,854
and he's obviously been beaten up about it
quite a bit.

834
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,399
But it still is something I wonder about.

835
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,529
<i>Early on,
the White House Coronavirus Task Force</i>

836
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,240
<i>was told we really have
a shortage of masks.</i>

837
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,493
And we didn't know at the time

838
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,663
that there was
a lot of asymptomatic spread.

839
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,040
We didn't know that.

840
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,794
Under those circumstances I said,
"We shouldn't really be wearing masks."

841
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,591
<i>And then when we found out
that 50 percent of the transmissions</i>

842
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,428
occur from someone without symptoms,
then it became clear,

843
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,431
holy smokes,
we really should be wearing a mask.

844
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,081
<i>There's been questions
over the past couple of weeks,</i>

845
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,272
<i>where is Dr. Fauci?</i>

846
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>Dr. Fauci's role minimized.</i>

847
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,529
<i>Yeah, apparently he hasn't spoken directly
with the President since June second.</i>

848
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,784
<i>We're seeing uptakes again
and nobody's hearing from you.</i>

849
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,952
Yeah.

850
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,913
<i>Do you still feel you have
some positive influence</i>

851
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:09,835
<i>through the Task Force
or is it just a waste of time now...</i>

852
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,170
- Well...
<i>- From the exterior,</i>

853
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:16,091
<i>it seems like a waste of time and Trump
is on a very different direction.</i>

854
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,427
Well, I think you just nailed it there,

855
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:24,558
because right now everything
is about opening the economy

856
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,476
and opening all the states.

857
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,815
<i>To my mind,
that's why the turning off</i>

858
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,109
<i>of your voice is such a tragedy.</i>

859
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:41,241
<i>You know, tell me to shut up...
because I keep blogging it...</i>

860
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,497
<i>but if you had a Twitter account,
you'd get literally millions of followers</i>

861
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,417
<i>- within the first 24 hours.</i>
- So, let me ask you a question.

862
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,295
What does having a Twitter account
actually mean?

863
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,591
You've got to type some stuff in
and just send it, is that what it is?

864
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,844
Do you got to respond to things?
I don't have any minutes.

865
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,607
<i>No, you don't have
to respond to anything.</i>

866
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,223
I don't have any minutes in the day.

867
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,642
<i>You're gonna get a million responses...</i>

868
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,936
<i>and you ignore them all</i>

869
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:15,859
<i>and then you start delivering
your classic public health messages,</i>

870
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,236
<i>avoiding politics...</i>

871
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,573
<i>but you've got millions of people
listening to you</i>

872
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,159
<i>and it's something
the White House wouldn't vet,</i>

873
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,621
<i>as long as you didn't cross
into the political realm.</i>

874
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,788
Right.

875
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,088
Here's the bad part.
When you do testing to that extent,

876
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,549
you're gonna find more people,
you're gonna find more cases.

877
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,803
So I said to my people,
"Slow the testing down, please."

878
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,766
<i>So, Dr. Fauci,
do you agree with that?</i>

879
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,476
It's the opposite.

880
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,394
We're gonna be doing more testing,
not less.

881
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,523
When you want to give
the American people confidence

882
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,944
<i>that they can trust the knowledge
and the wisdom</i>

883
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,073
coming out the US government.
It behooves us to put the scientists

884
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,783
and the doctors front and center.

885
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,353
<i>We're going
in the wrong direction.</i>

886
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,707
If you look at the curves
of the new cases,

887
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,293
clearly we are not in total control
right now.

888
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:19,005
Well, Dr. Doom himself,
spreading more COVID panic

889
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,882
and undermining Trump's agenda.

890
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,677
<i>Honestly, I think Trump
needs to send him back to his office</i>

891
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,470
<i>and shut the door and say,
"Very nice.</i>

892
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,806
<i>"Thank you so much for your thoughts.
We're moving on."</i>

893
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,810
<i>As a country, we went up,
came down,</i>

894
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,895
<i>but instead of going all the way down</i>

895
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,816
we plateaued
at around 20,000 cases per day.

896
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:41,528
Trade advisor Peter Navarro
wrote this Op-Ed saying,

897
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,280
<i>"Anthony Fauci has been wrong</i>

898
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,324
<i>about everything
I have interacted with him on."</i>

899
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,453
<i>What I've been trying to do
is to get people to realize</i>

900
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>how important it is to do
the fundamental public health measures,</i>

901
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,543
<i>because if we don't do that,</i>

902
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,045
we are afraid
things could actually get worse.

903
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:03,717
Why on earth would your Administration
be involved in a campaign at this point

904
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,927
to discredit Dr. Fauci?

905
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,220
Because we're not.

906
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,141
If one man from my Administration
doesn't like him

907
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,934
because he made a few mistakes.

908
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,853
Look, Dr. Fauci said,
"Don't wear masks,"

909
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,064
Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China,
it would be a big mistake.

910
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,608
<i>Fire Fauci!</i>

911
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,571
<i>Fire Fauci, fire Fauci, fire Fauci!</i>

912
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,241
<i>Of course he was disturbed
by any way</i>

913
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,703
<i>in which these attacks
muddied the message</i>

914
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:36,041
or created a distraction
from the real set of issues,

915
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:40,837
<i>but the more personal stuff
that was upsetting to me</i>

916
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,464
<i>and my sisters and my mom.</i>

917
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,425
He, as best as he could
and I don't know how he did it,

918
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,628
just put that off the table.

919
00:55:56,144 --> 00:56:00,565
<i>When someone attacks
I don't immediately fight back.</i>

920
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,983
<i>That's not my style.</i>

921
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,195
<i>I don't get into the fray.</i>

922
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,075
<i>And over the years,
which became decades,</i>

923
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,452
<i>that became my mantra.</i>

924
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,790
<i>Using the </i>Godfather
<i>as the great book of philosophy,</i>

925
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,501
it's nothing personal,
it's strictly business.

926
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,586
<i>We'll never be silent again.</i>

927
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,147
<i>- We'll never be silent again.
- Fight back.</i>

928
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,672
<i>Nineteen thousand people a day.</i>

929
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,968
<i>If 19,000 grandmothers or boy scouts
or 11 boy scouts had died,</i>

930
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,637
we'd go bananas in this country.

931
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,722
<i>Murder! Murder! Murder!</i>

932
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,809
<i>The only people in charge
of AIDS are incompetent hacks.</i>

933
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,144
You know, the rage is so intense,

934
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,856
what do you do to make a government fight
to do something

935
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,359
to save 40,000 people?

936
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:54,911
My first evidence
that there was anger out there...

937
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,792
at the government's response
to HIV-AIDS was an article

938
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,963
<i>which had the headline,
"An Open Letter To Incompetent Idiot.</i>

939
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,424
<i>"I Call You A Murderer,
Dr. Anthony Fauci."</i>

940
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:12,011
<i>And went on saying
just what a complete disaster I was.</i>

941
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,323
<i>I didn't know what I was doing.
I was this, I was that.</i>

942
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,142
And I said,
"Oh, my God, what did I do to this guy?"

943
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,395
Dr. Anthony Fauci is God in AIDS research.

944
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,691
He's just been inhumane, I guess,
is the only thing I can say.

945
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,736
<i>It was written by a man
named Larry Kramer,</i>

946
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:34,784
<i>who was a firebrand
that was leading a group called ACT UP.</i>

947
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,788
Act up! Stand tall!
It's time for action, City Hall!

948
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,999
If you go ACT UP to a scientist
they go...

949
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,794
You know, ACT UP, my God.
You know, run away from ACT UP.

950
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,839
<i>The demonstrations
are the work of ACT UP.</i>

951
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,509
A group which believes
that with 76,000 Americans

952
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,219
already dead as a result of AIDS,

953
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,763
<i>it is imperative
to get the message across,</i>

954
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,350
<i>even if people are sometimes given
to outrage because of the message.</i>

955
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,979
<i>As the deaths mounted...</i>

956
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,317
there was a realization that
if we didn't do something,

957
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,654
we were all going to die
and the country would just let us die.

958
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,550
<i>I'll never forget
the first meeting.</i>

959
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:18,453
<i>It was in the West Village.
And I went in and there was this energy.</i>

960
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,246
<i>It was just like, it...</i>

961
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:25,960
It was indescribable. And I felt hopeful
for the first time.

962
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,838
<i>None of us had a background
in science.</i>

963
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,843
<i>I was a lawyer,
somebody else was a graphic designer,</i>

964
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,262
<i>somebody else studied Russian poetry.</i>

965
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:41,809
Science was not where we came from,
but we began to learn.

966
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:46,105
And... we started having questions
about the studies.

967
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,570
I'd probably come over Fauci's name
during my own research,

968
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,406
but it hadn't really clicked yet,

969
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,286
but all of a sudden we were talking
about Tony Fauci at ACT UP meetings.

970
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:04,040
Tony Fauci was... the enemy.

971
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,259
For me, I had just lost my partner.
I was...

972
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:20,139
in grief and we needed drugs.
We needed them yesterday.

973
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,810
ACT UP's focus
was always drugs into bodies.

974
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,645
That's what the motto was.

975
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,625
<i>Make sure that
we could find treatment</i>

976
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,442
<i>for HIV and AIDS for people</i>

977
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,945
<i>and make sure that it was accessible
to everyone.</i>

978
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,242
AIDS patients breaking the law,
in a desperate battle

979
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,660
to save their own lives.

980
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,453
<i>Many are now treating themselves</i>

981
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,039
<i>with medications not yet approved
by the government.</i>

982
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:50,336
<i>We were fighting with the FDA
over access to an experimental drug</i>

983
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:54,215
to treat the pneumonia
that was the leading cause of death

984
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,134
amongst people with AIDS.

985
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,262
It was an approved drug already
for cancer patients

986
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,015
<i>that had immune suppression
and it worked for them.</i>

987
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:08,313
And Tony said "No,
we're not really interested in that.

988
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,149
<i>"We're interested in this drug AZT</i>

989
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,443
<i>and that's where we're gonna put
our resources."</i>

990
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,696
<i>About a year later,</i>

991
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,369
I think 16 or 18,000 people with AIDS
died of PCP pneumonia.

992
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,165
And we accused him
of causing those deaths.

993
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,711
<i>This government isn't equipped
to put 10,000 people into a trial.</i>

994
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,837
<i>It is so disorganized.</i>

995
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,505
<i>There are so many committees.</i>

996
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,923
<i>But it could be equipped.</i>

997
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,901
If Tony Fauci were courageous enough
to whisper...

998
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,445
<i>I want to stay away from the politics.</i>

999
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,639
In President Bush's ear
let's do something about this plague.

1000
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:49,187
It was a little confusing because I,
who had been knocking myself out,

1001
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:55,485
trying to do the right thing,
was the object of the anger.

1002
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,033
<i>But then something happened
within me and I said,</i>

1003
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,079
"You know, something's going on
that I'm missing here."

1004
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,670
<i>And that's when I started
to really reach out.</i>

1005
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,799
<i>It was pretty much the first
and only time, I think,</i>

1006
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:23,096
in ACT UP's early history
where anybody in government came to us.

1007
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,348
ACT UP REP 1:

1008
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,644
<i>We invited him to come
to an ACT UP meeting.</i>

1009
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:35,692
He knew that he was gonna face an audience
that was hostile and distrustful.

1010
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,736
ACT UP MEMBER 1:

1011
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:58,965
<i>It was quite a scene.
I went up there to listen to them</i>

1012
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,759
and to try and explain to them
the rationale

1013
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,847
for why we were doing what we were doing,
even though they did not agree.

1014
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,016
ACT UP MEMBER 2:

1015
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:26,117
The criticism, the hostility,
it didn't really seem to phase him.

1016
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:46,095
My first impression
was that we're dealing with Brooklyn here.

1017
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:50,516
<i>He got a complete grilling
and continued the conversation.</i>

1018
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,113
<i>We didn't agree on everything
in that first meeting,</i>

1019
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,365
<i>but their instincts were right.</i>

1020
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:13,456
<i>And that started a series of dialogs</i>

1021
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:18,169
that did not stop the demonstrations.

1022
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:22,048
It's a lie, it's a sham,
it won't work!

1023
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,883
It's a lie, it's a sham!

1024
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,927
<i>Although we were making progress</i>

1025
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:30,598
in coming to some rapprochement,
as it were,

1026
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:36,270
they still thought that something
wasn't happening quickly enough.

1027
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,777
<i>He did not want to do anything
that was considered rocking the boat</i>

1028
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,072
about scientific norms
and the scientific establishment.

1029
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,868
<i>If you don't forge ahead,
you get accused of being too slow.</i>

1030
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,539
<i>I'm just gonna have to do what's right
and do my job</i>

1031
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,291
and know that this is the right thing
for biomedical science,

1032
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,502
the right thing
for the health of this country.

1033
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,882
<i>How you design a clinical trial
and how you evaluate those results,</i>

1034
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:10,304
the time it takes to go from the beginning
up to the time it actually gets approved

1035
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:15,351
were what you would refer to
as sacrosanct processes.

1036
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,397
<i>Rigidity was perfection.</i>

1037
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,278
The reasons I can't get any of these drugs
is because the leadership in this country

1038
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,114
has failed to come up
with a plan of action.

1039
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,032
<i>Bottom line.</i>

1040
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:34,203
The government's AIDS research effort,
which he is supposedly in charge of...

1041
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,330
isn't producing.

1042
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,835
The Federal Government's
AIDS research program is flawed.

1043
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,297
So, we're going to have
a small but tasteful little gathering

1044
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,466
at the National Institutes of Health
on May 21st.

1045
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,052
Storm the NIH.

1046
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,264
<i>I called Tony and I said,
"We're coming."</i>

1047
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:56,809
And it was game on.

1048
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,900
Every 12 minutes someone dies.

1049
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,153
<i>A group calling itself ACT UP</i>

1050
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,863
<i>wants changes in AIDS research.</i>

1051
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:12,617
Asking for wider and faster testing
of AIDS fighting drugs.

1052
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,829
Here's your money, NIH!
Here's your money, NIH!

1053
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,999
<i>Mounted police
and others wearing rubber gloves</i>

1054
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,126
<i>confronted about 1,000 AIDS activists.</i>

1055
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,800
<i>They won't test
any of these drugs</i>

1056
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,971
<i>that will keep people alive.
No Peptide T, no Compound Q.</i>

1057
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,265
Anthony Fauci, I piss on you.

1058
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,602
The NIH is lying!
Women with AIDS are dying!

1059
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:45,524
Their decisions for our women,
children, people of color is always no.

1060
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,653
Dr. Anthony Fauci
and a lot of other hotshot scientists

1061
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,113
are having conferences
deciding research priorities.

1062
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,801
We think we should be deciding
the research priorities.

1063
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,345
These are the people who know
what's going on

1064
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,079
because they're dealing with it every day.

1065
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:04,377
<i>I started to put myself
into their shoes</i>

1066
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,421
<i>and finally I realized
what they really wanted</i>

1067
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,423
<i>is to be part of the process.</i>

1068
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,094
I have a disease.
I'm gonna be dead in X number of months.

1069
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,013
You've just given me a plan
that something is gonna happen

1070
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,181
in three years.

1071
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,266
Thank you very much,
but I'm gonna be dead.

1072
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,394
So we need to do a little bit more
about that.

1073
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,397
<i>Typical day at the NIH
watching people die!</i>

1074
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,024
<i>And I started to feel,</i>

1075
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,527
<i>and my staff thought
I was completely nuts...</i>

1076
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,072
almost an affinity... to them.

1077
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:41,163
I pulled a banner out of my backpack
and I'm starting to tape it up

1078
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:45,292
<i>and then all of a sudden,
all these cops are lifting each other up.</i>

1079
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,170
They're angry that they've been fooled.

1080
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:56,595
<i>And they lower me down into the arms
of all the other cops.</i>

1081
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,726
<i>And the commander says,
"Take him through the building."</i>

1082
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:08,524
Halfway down the hall
I see a very familiar sight.

1083
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:13,946
A short man in a white coat.

1084
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:21,203
And, uh, he goes... "Peter?"

1085
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,207
And Peter looks me in the eye,
he says, "Tony, I did it. I got arrested.

1086
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,792
"I told you I'd get arrested."

1087
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:31,005
And the cop looks at me and says,
"What the shit is going on here?

1088
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,674
"Who is this guy? He's your friend?"

1089
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,802
Because he knows
this is the Director of the Building

1090
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,389
and, like, "Who the hell is this guy
I'm arresting?"

1091
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,851
We completely befuddled the police.

1092
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,899
<i>Tony understood that
what we were doing was political theater</i>

1093
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,817
<i>to move an issue along.</i>

1094
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,321
<i>He never stopped being open.</i>

1095
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,408
He never said, "The way you treated me
at that demonstration,

1096
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,285
"I'm never gonna talk
to you people again."

1097
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,955
Instead, it was exactly the opposite.
It's "We need to talk more."

1098
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:14,173
<i>There was a lot of push back
on the part of some of my own staff,</i>

1099
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:18,677
that I was compromising
the scientific process.

1100
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:23,557
You can't have activists involved
in our meetings

1101
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,602
where we discuss the design
of a clinical trial.

1102
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,650
<i>By that summer,
with the International AIDS Conference</i>

1103
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,860
<i>about to happen in San Francisco,</i>

1104
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,905
<i>the relationship
between the scientific establishment</i>

1105
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,867
and ACT UP was at a breaking point.

1106
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,789
<i>About 100 protesters
have already been arrested</i>

1107
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,209
at the International AIDS Conference
that began today in San Francisco.

1108
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,045
<i>Researchers feel
that they're undervalued.</i>

1109
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,495
<i>If they feel that they're gonna be
demonstrated against,</i>

1110
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,842
they'll just get out
and do their work in cancer

1111
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,386
and Alzheimer's disease and heart,
what have you.

1112
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,767
You can beat them down
by this constant harassment.

1113
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:12,481
<i>Larry Kramer called for riots.
It was getting out of hand.</i>

1114
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:16,610
And then the organizers of the conference
tried to placate ACT UP.

1115
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,823
<i>They said "If you want to speak,
it's yours."</i>

1116
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:27,413
Exactly 30 days ago,
all of us here in the front

1117
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,250
stood up for what we believed in
and vocalized our commitment

1118
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,628
on the beautiful grounds
of the National Institutes of Health.

1119
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:39,091
When we make mistakes, what's the fallout?

1120
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,220
Some people become offended
and begin to hate ACT UP.

1121
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,350
Whereas, when government
or scientific community makes a mistake,

1122
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,853
thousands of people can die.

1123
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:58,152
It became patently clear to me
that they were making absolute sense.

1124
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:00,571
It gives me great pleasure
to welcome Dr. Fauci.

1125
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,894
It's an honor to have him here.

1126
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:13,042
AIDS in the 1990s has revolutionized
the relationship

1127
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,752
between the public and scientists.

1128
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,964
The politically charged nature
of the epidemic has put researchers

1129
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,592
under an extraordinary degree
of public scrutiny.

1130
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:26,555
They are confronted with the accusation
by some that they are not doing enough

1131
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,224
and that they are moving too slowly.

1132
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,562
I'm not finished.

1133
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:40,486
The scientific process is often seen
as overly restrictive

1134
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,279
and even an impediment to solution.

1135
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:48,369
<i>The most vocal, provocative
and articulate groups among these</i>

1136
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,995
<i>are the AIDS Activists.</i>

1137
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:54,583
Some of them are better informed
than many scientists can possibly imagine.

1138
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:01,924
Yet they are sometimes incorrect.

1139
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,845
Believe it or not.

1140
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,849
However, in the interactions

1141
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,352
between physicians, scientists
and activists,

1142
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,188
mistakes have been made by both sides.

1143
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:22,236
Activists are mistaken when they assume
that scientists do not care about them.

1144
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,948
This is devastating
to a physician scientist

1145
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,325
who has devoted years to AIDS research,

1146
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:30,494
<i>particularly when they themselves</i>

1147
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,497
<i>see so many of their own patients
suffering and dying.</i>

1148
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:38,085
<i>On the other hand,
scientists cannot dismiss activists</i>

1149
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:42,214
<i>merely on the basis of the fact
that they are not trained scientists.</i>

1150
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,510
Activists bring a very special insight
into the disease

1151
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,013
that they can actually be helpful

1152
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:52,683
in the way that we design
our scientific approaches.

1153
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,986
We must join together,
for together we a formidable force

1154
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,487
with a common goal.

1155
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:09,533
We must never lose sight of the fact
that the people whom we serve

1156
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,786
are the HIV infected people
throughout the world. Thank you.

1157
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:32,056
<i>During that speech,
I'm saying something</i>

1158
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,683
and you have the activists clap.

1159
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,270
Then I say something
and the scientists clap.

1160
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:44,943
The beauty of it is that...
at the end of it, everybody was clapping.

1161
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,075
<i>The AIDS activists
went from being the adversaries</i>

1162
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,410
to actually the people
who were sitting down

1163
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,662
at the table with us discussing
what is happening.

1164
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:01,835
And that is a huge shift.
That changed everything.

1165
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:06,423
We were able to redesign
clinical trials for HIV.

1166
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:11,095
<i>Black people, Brown people,
pregnant women,</i>

1167
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,472
<i>young people were included.</i>

1168
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,601
I'm putting myself at your disposal now.
If I don't have an answer for it...

1169
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:19,937
<i>And your thinking,
has it changed your approach</i>

1170
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,688
<i>to research on life threatening disease?</i>

1171
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,650
Rather than a real abrupt change,
I think it's an evolution.

1172
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:31,115
You try harder to put yourself
into the position of a patient.

1173
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,911
<i>This whole notion of understanding
that we have a value</i>

1174
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:37,830
in those discussions

1175
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,834
changed the shape of clinical research
and drug development.

1176
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,420
And it went well beyond AIDS.

1177
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,839
- What do we want?
- A cure!

1178
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,049
- When do we want it?
- Now!

1179
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,887
<i>Now it happens in cancer
and it happens in Alzheimer's</i>

1180
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,557
<i>and it happens
in all these different disease areas.</i>

1181
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,394
<i>Science has realized</i>

1182
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,980
you need to include these voices
in the process

1183
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,065
because it makes for better science.

1184
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:09,611
<i>And Tony is the one who opened that door.</i>

1185
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:13,991
We're the ones who knocked on that door
and pushed that door

1186
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,534
and barged our way in.

1187
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,120
But Tony understood the value of it
early on.

1188
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,253
<i>The difference now
is that divisiveness</i>

1189
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,007
<i>is dominating COVID-19.</i>

1190
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,304
I don't see them ever clapping together.

1191
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,598
I think we're gonna get through it.

1192
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:45,772
But we're gonna get through it
in spite of this divisiveness

1193
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,983
and this politicization.

1194
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,987
We're not gonna get through it
because of it.

1195
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,714
<i>- Peter!
- Hey. How are you?</i>

1196
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,008
<i>Oh, I'm all right.</i>

1197
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:18,055
These fucking dark web people

1198
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,938
- are really, really getting bad.
<i>- All right.</i>

1199
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,601
They're really, really harassing Chris.

1200
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:27,606
One of them called up...
with violent threats,

1201
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,192
like eight times today
on her cell phone

1202
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,569
until she figured I've got to just change
my cell phone.

1203
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,908
You know, they're harassing
my daughters constantly,

1204
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:40,077
which it really bothers me
more than anything else.

1205
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,247
<i>Remind her that almost all of them
are cowards.</i>

1206
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,665
- Yeah.
<i>- All just...</i>

1207
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,125
Well, that's
what my Secret Service detail says.

1208
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,353
- They say... I mean...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1209
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,257
Because they have a lot of experience
with this.

1210
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,923
And, you know, they don't want
to make light of it,

1211
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:56,301
but they say that most of them
are just a bunch of fricking cowards.

1212
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,055
<i>They want to scare you all.</i>

1213
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:02,349
- Right.
<i>- They want you to back down.</i>

1214
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,600
Right.

1215
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:12,067
When COVID hit, at first, it was like,
oh, my God,

1216
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,153
give Tony space while he does his thing.

1217
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,197
Uh, don't overwhelm him.

1218
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,783
Let's try to figure out
what's going wrong.

1219
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:26,164
<i>And then when he became this target,</i>

1220
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,250
I just kept checking in.

1221
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,342
<i>For me and my sisters
this was really, really new territory.</i>

1222
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,264
<i>We heard about what he went through
in the HIV AIDS pandemic.</i>

1223
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,560
<i>Like seeing signs, you know,
"Fauci is a murderer."</i>

1224
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,606
And I remember asking him, like,
"Is this what it was like?

1225
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,234
"Was I just not old enough to understand,
but this is actually what it was like?"

1226
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,195
And, you know,
his response is something like,

1227
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,991
"You can't even compare the two.
This is so beyond the beyond."

1228
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,371
<i>The whole atmosphere...</i>

1229
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,251
<i>strains your concept of what normality is.</i>

1230
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,923
<i>You know, and just when you think
everything is okay,</i>

1231
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,217
<i>I was sitting at my desk
and I opened up a letter</i>

1232
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,178
and a puff of powder came up.

1233
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:26,183
It was on my shirt, my tie, my pants,
my hands and my chin.

1234
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,393
The first thing I thought of was,

1235
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,979
"Holy shit,
why did I open up this letter?"

1236
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:36,652
<i>And then the options started
to crystallize in my mind.</i>

1237
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,572
One, it's a hoax.

1238
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:45,702
Two, it's anthrax
and I'm gonna get sick,

1239
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,996
but I'm gonna take Cipro
and I'm gonna be okay.

1240
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:52,501
Or three, it's Ricin
and I'm freakin' dead.

1241
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,884
<i>Fortunately, it turned out to be a hoax.</i>

1242
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,013
<i>My sisters and I
were really worried.</i>

1243
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,642
And that was...

1244
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,979
It continues to be really disturbing,
really unsettling.

1245
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,070
I don't understand the hate
that people have.

1246
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:23,657
And the hate that leads them
to do something

1247
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,784
that could hurt somebody
or kill somebody.

1248
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:31,957
I mean, it sort of... reduces my trust
in humanity

1249
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,711
in a way that is probably impossible
to measure.

1250
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,462
But certainly, I felt it.

1251
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:13,457
I never, for a moment,
thought that I should resign.

1252
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,127
<i>I just never thought about it.</i>

1253
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,591
<i>I just said to myself...</i>

1254
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,303
<i>focus on what you're trying to do.</i>

1255
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:34,186
<i>Is what you're trying to do more important
than all of this other peripheral crap?</i>

1256
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:40,358
<i>If it is, just focus like a laser
and go for it.</i>

1257
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:43,987
<i>Okay.</i>

1258
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,073
I just realized that I haven't had
a good night's sleep

1259
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,533
in a very, very long time.

1260
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:52,871
I'm waiting until the first person
enters into the phase three trial...

1261
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,541
and then,
I'll have a good night's sleep, so.

1262
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,835
<i>That will be Moderna, mRNA.</i>

1263
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:01,671
No, no. I know that,
but I'm holding my breath

1264
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,507
until that happens.

1265
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:06,468
It must be something psychological.

1266
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,096
I keep waking up at 2:30
'til quarter to three in the morning.

1267
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:16,061
<i>Despite this extraordinary divisiveness...</i>

1268
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:20,232
it was very clear we were dealing
with a common enemy

1269
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:23,401
and the common enemy was the virus.

1270
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:29,950
I really do hope that somehow or other
there is a realization

1271
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,036
that we can't go on this way,

1272
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:37,374
because it's a lesson that will be,
I think, important for us

1273
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,793
to adequately respond
to the next outbreak,

1274
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,087
which inevitably will occur.

1275
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:46,466
Maybe not in my lifetime, maybe it will,
but it will occur.

1276
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:54,140
My dad said on TV, on the radio,
to me, to my mom,

1277
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,727
to my sisters, like,
"We're gonna get through it."

1278
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,523
And he's held that with him
through this whole thing,

1279
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,568
when so many people, the whole country,

1280
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,672
so many of us have struggled to think,
are we ever gonna get through this thing?

1281
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,156
- Are you all set?
- I know.

1282
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,409
<i>Somehow he's been able
to hold onto that</i>

1283
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:17,247
<i>because he's lived in times
where it felt like a thing couldn't end.</i>

1284
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,384
<i>The search
for an AIDS vaccine...</i>

1285
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,636
<i>that hope now has dimmed.</i>

1286
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:35,974
More than a decade into the AIDS epidemic,
we're still nowhere close to a cure.

1287
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,768
<i>Since the late '80s, we've seen</i>

1288
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,246
<i>pretty splashy reports in the media</i>

1289
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,272
<i>about drugs that worked well
in the test tube</i>

1290
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:45,650
and then find out in a few months
that they did not work in people.

1291
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:49,446
<i>This is the bitter new reality of AIDS.</i>

1292
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:53,074
<i>There are more drugs around
to prolong patients' lives,</i>

1293
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,286
<i>but their deaths
are more excruciating than ever.</i>

1294
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,748
The biomedical research community
is suffering,

1295
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:01,583
for not having solved the problem.

1296
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,753
<i>Our country says,
"Why can't you guys do this?"</i>

1297
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,756
<i>It is conceivable
that we will never get a vaccine.</i>

1298
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:09,549
<i>I think we have to face that reality.</i>

1299
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,468
People sometimes hesitate
to talk about that

1300
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:14,405
because it gets taken out of context
and people say well, they're giving up.

1301
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:15,639
No-one is giving up.

1302
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,329
<i>There were a number of studies
that were going on</i>

1303
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,521
<i>that were funded by my institute.</i>

1304
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:27,359
<i>We had gradual progress...</i>

1305
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,070
but never the home run.

1306
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:35,659
<i>And then, in 1996,
there are a couple of studies</i>

1307
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:42,207
that incorporated protease inhibitors
as one of three drugs

1308
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,167
that were given in combination.

1309
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,794
On <i>Close Up</i> this morning,

1310
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:48,088
reports of possible new treatments
for AIDS.

1311
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,799
<i>AIDS drugs known
as protease inhibitors</i>

1312
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:54,511
<i>may actually eliminate the AIDS virus
in human tissue.</i>

1313
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,932
I'd had the pneumonias
and I was getting skinnier...

1314
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,518
and I didn't have much fight left in me.

1315
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:06,022
<i>And I got down here with NIH in 1995</i>

1316
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:08,942
<i>and I was one of the first people
in the country</i>

1317
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,360
<i>that was given the cocktail.</i>

1318
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,738
And seven days later,
my numbers had started to change.

1319
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,033
And my T cells started to rise and...

1320
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,954
my viral burden started to go down.

1321
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:25,166
I just need a second. Uh...

1322
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,590
Um...

1323
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,054
That was the moment that changed my life.

1324
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:43,268
<i>I started getting better.</i>

1325
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,025
<i>Immune systems are restoring
back to normalcy,</i>

1326
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:52,152
the virus is disappearing.

1327
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,447
It's gotten to levels so low,
it can't even be found.

1328
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,741
It's called the AIDS cocktail.

1329
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:01,536
And the success of the cocktail
is the first real sign

1330
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:04,372
that the AIDS epidemic
may not be invincible.

1331
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,168
<i>It really was, like,
the most amazing thing</i>

1332
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:12,422
to go from a physician
to terminally ill patients

1333
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,341
to a physician who could prevent people
from dying.

1334
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,971
<i>It's the best we've seen
thus far with any drugs.</i>

1335
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,015
The effects are profound.

1336
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:26,144
I'm certain they're going to be translated
into positive clinical benefits.

1337
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,022
<i>I no longer feel
as though I'm dying, I no longer crave it.</i>

1338
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:32,275
I don't have contingency plans
to end my life.

1339
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:36,738
I'm not in that mode at all.
I'm back among the living.

1340
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:39,074
I'm a grandmother,
but that's only one grandchild.

1341
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,343
I still have two other children
that don't have children.

1342
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:42,952
You know, I want a house full.

1343
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:46,164
And if I keep taking my medicine
I'm gonna be here

1344
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,166
to rock every single one of them
on my lap.

1345
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,712
It's nice to have new things
down the road to look forward to.

1346
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:55,131
Yeah, I feel like I'm 16 again,
it's great.

1347
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,301
Every birthday since I've been 35...

1348
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,596
there isn't one birthday, not one,

1349
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,684
that I don't thank him
for what he has done for me.

1350
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:19,697
My dad turned 80 this year
and it was the first birthday,

1351
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,034
Christmas Eve, Christmas
that we weren't all together.

1352
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:27,330
<i>Since I was a little kid,</i>

1353
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,040
I've often taken the role of...

1354
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,628
you know, telling him,
like, "You have to take a break.

1355
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:36,073
"You have to slow down.
You have to take care of yourself."

1356
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,260
<i>But I saw that as long
as the COVID pandemic</i>

1357
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,096
was happening, he was gonna be all in.

1358
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:48,768
<i>So, I tried to be there for him
in a different kind of way from afar.</i>

1359
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:54,232
<i>Checking in with him, calling him,
sending him text messages of birds,</i>

1360
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:57,193
sending him pictures of my dog.
Something to keep him going.

1361
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:02,907
<i>Right now,
what I'm going through...</i>

1362
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,912
is kind of like a diabolical repeat...

1363
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:13,960
of what went on
back when they were children growing up.

1364
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:21,134
<i>But now they're adults
and they see what I'm going through...</i>

1365
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,428
<i>and what Chris is going through.</i>

1366
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:30,768
<i>And... they are just amazingly supportive</i>

1367
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,437
<i>and proud.</i>

1368
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,774
<i>- Hi, Ali.
- Hey, Ali, babe. Hey, Jane.</i>

1369
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,943
<i>- Megan's there too.
- Hey, Megan D.</i>

1370
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,197
Hi, sweet thing. I love you.

1371
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,073
<i>- I love you too.</i>
- Take care.

1372
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,284
I wish you guys were here.

1373
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:54,167
<i>As much as I've given my dad
a hard time my whole life,</i>

1374
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:59,214
I'm so grateful to see an example
of what it means

1375
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:03,301
to stay committed to who you are
and stay committed to what you believe in.

1376
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:11,351
<i>With HIV AIDS,</i>

1377
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,687
<i>when we finally nailed down
the triple combination</i>

1378
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,565
<i>that brought down the level of virus
to below detectable,</i>

1379
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,817
<i>it was close to euphoria.</i>

1380
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,320
<i>People were going back</i>

1381
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:27,367
to what turned out to be
a semi normal existence.

1382
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:32,747
But that then shined a bright light
on the disparity

1383
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,959
between the developed world
and the developing world.

1384
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:15,123
<i>Inequality raises its head
in many different ways in our world.</i>

1385
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:18,209
HIV AIDS, it was very clear...

1386
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,754
we could get those pills
for those people or not.

1387
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:26,301
What would that cost to give patients
the drugs that they need?

1388
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,553
Six hundred US dollars per month.

1389
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,972
And a man like this,
how much would he make a month?

1390
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:33,016
Maybe five, ten dollars.

1391
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:52,327
<i>The perspective was,
we'll never be able to do that in Africa,</i>

1392
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,203
for all sorts of crazy reasons.

1393
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,206
Not enough money,
people wouldn't take medications,

1394
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,374
it's impossible.

1395
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:01,711
These drugs have to be administered
during a certain sequence

1396
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:03,087
at a time during the day

1397
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,018
and when you say,
"Take it at ten o'clock."

1398
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,425
People will say,
"What do you mean by ten o'clock?"

1399
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:10,057
If you've traveled rural Africa,
you know this.

1400
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,263
This is not a criticism,
just a different world.

1401
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:14,974
People do not know
what watches and clocks are.

1402
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:19,479
They do not use Western means
for telling the time. They use the sun.

1403
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:25,276
<i>Early in my Administration,
Condi Rice said "Mr. President,</i>

1404
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:29,322
<i>"are you aware there's a pandemic
destroying an entire generation of people</i>

1405
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:30,698
<i>in the continent of Africa?"</i>

1406
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,242
<i>I said,
"We need to do something about it."</i>

1407
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:37,580
People in my Administration
whose judgment I trust said, you know,

1408
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,706
"Unleash Fauci."

1409
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,753
<i>Tony Fauci doesn't come
in the Oval Office and say,</i>

1410
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:46,047
"I'm gonna make you look good
politically."

1411
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:48,800
He's not a politician.

1412
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,347
<i>Tony Fauci says,
"I think we can solve this problem.</i>

1413
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:55,848
<i>"Here are the facts,</i>

1414
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:58,684
and here's my recommendation
for a way forward."

1415
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,107
<i>So, President Bush told me,
"Go to Africa</i>

1416
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,902
and scout it out.
See if there's something that we can do."

1417
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:15,326
<i>In Uganda, what we saw was,
I believe,</i>

1418
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,204
<i>what many people think
would not be able to be effected...</i>

1419
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:22,625
<i>and that is groups of volunteers
on motorcycles and jeeps</i>

1420
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:28,047
<i>going into the very, very rural areas,
into the homes of people</i>

1421
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,299
<i>and delivering drugs.</i>

1422
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:42,353
<i>I remember going
into a thatched hut.</i>

1423
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,147
<i>"How are you doing?" "Fine."</i>

1424
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,567
<i>"You're taking your medicines?"
"Yes, I'm taking them very regularly."</i>

1425
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,902
"You understand
what the medicine is doing?"

1426
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:53,948
"Yes, it's blocking the virus
that's killing my CD4 cells."

1427
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,033
Like, what?

1428
01:30:57,493 --> 01:31:00,121
<i>All of this stuff that people were saying,</i>

1429
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:03,332
that Africans don't have
whatever it is it takes

1430
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:07,253
to understand the importance
of taking their drug regularly

1431
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:11,048
was clearly, you know,
unmitigated bullshit.

1432
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:18,890
We put together a model
that was a phenomenally expanded version

1433
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,184
of what Peter Mugyenyi was already doing.

1434
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:25,897
<i>He had people delivering drugs
that weren't even nurses</i>

1435
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:30,610
<i>on motorcycles into the bush.
You know, hundreds of miles away.</i>

1436
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:32,778
And people would take the drug.

1437
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:35,542
They knew what they were doing.
You could get their viral load down.

1438
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,578
All you needed to do
was to give them the drugs.

1439
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:44,624
<i>So, I put forth to the president
a 15 billion dollar program called PEPFAR.</i>

1440
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,794
The President's Emergency Plan
For AIDS Relief.

1441
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,673
I ask the Congress to commit
15 billion dollars

1442
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,091
over the next five years,

1443
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,969
including nearly ten billion dollars
in new money

1444
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:01,390
to turn the tide against AIDS
in the most afflicted nations of Africa

1445
01:32:01,557 --> 01:32:02,642
and the Caribbean.

1446
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:13,694
Fifteen billion dollars. Boom!
It was just the most magnificent moment,

1447
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,198
uh, because I knew what that really meant.

1448
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:38,302
<i>We're talking
about preventing seven million infections.</i>

1449
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:42,640
In other words, seven million people
who otherwise would have gotten infected

1450
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:44,934
and with no therapy would have died.

1451
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:07,373
<i>PEPFAR was a huge milestone,</i>

1452
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,668
this, you know,
miraculous AIDS intervention

1453
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:15,131
that... continues to save
tens of millions of lives.

1454
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:18,801
<i>It's the largest
bilateral program in health</i>

1455
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,511
<i>ever created anywhere</i>

1456
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,432
and Tony was an early architect of it
and it changed the world.

1457
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:31,147
<i>Tony's been made the size
of the tasks he takes on.</i>

1458
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,527
He becomes the size of the challenge
he faces each time.

1459
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:42,033
AIDS is one of the most
devastating scourges in human history.

1460
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:46,412
The US President's Emergency Plan
For AIDS Relief has done heroic work

1461
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:49,248
in making AIDS drugs available
to those who need them.

1462
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,294
Striving for universal access
to AIDS therapies

1463
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:58,841
is a public health and moral imperative
that should be embraced by all.

1464
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:09,018
I mean that, to me, is, you know,
one of the great success stories

1465
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:10,436
in all of medicine.

1466
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:14,565
<i>When you have a global pandemic,</i>

1467
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:19,028
you absolutely need a global solution.

1468
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:24,533
<i>To think that you can take care
of yourself</i>

1469
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:28,871
without taking care
of the rest of the world is just folly.

1470
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:55,898
<i>What the NIH has accomplished,
can accomplish and will accomplish,</i>

1471
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:59,819
to me, that's the embodiment
of the American spirit.

1472
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:05,825
<i>The experience that you can do anything
if you put your mind to it, anything.</i>

1473
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,993
- Hi, Dr. Azar.
- Hi, guys.

1474
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:11,038
- Hi, Dr. Fauci.
- These are out health care workers.

1475
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,962
- Good morning, Dr. Fauci.
- How are you doing?

1476
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:15,090
- Good. How are you?
- And one behind us here.

1477
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,127
I'm good.

1478
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:20,673
And I have to take one with you.
My daughter will kill me if I don't.

1479
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:25,553
<i>Having lived through
this extraordinary, historic experience,</i>

1480
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:31,642
it just confirms it's always
the sustained investment in science

1481
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:33,853
that rises to the occasion.

1482
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:37,565
It is fitting that
we gather here today on NIH campus

1483
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:41,277
to administer vaccines
designed to battle COVID-19.

1484
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:46,115
<i>The young people in medicine
really need to understand</i>

1485
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,408
what is possible

1486
01:35:48,325 --> 01:35:53,622
when the biomedical research community
of this country and the world

1487
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:59,336
decides that they're going after a problem
in a very serious way.

1488
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,964
Next we have Dr. Tony Fauci.

1489
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,510
Many in our nation are saying

1490
01:36:06,635 --> 01:36:09,430
if Dr. Fauci gets the vaccine,
I'm gonna get the vaccine.

1491
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,390
So, tell us a little bit
why it's important?

1492
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:14,393
Well, to me,
it's important for two reasons.

1493
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:18,606
One is that I'm an attending
physician here on the staff

1494
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:20,858
at the National Institutes
of Health Clinical Center

1495
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:25,029
and so I do see patients.
But, as important, or more important,

1496
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:29,575
is as a symbol to the rest of the country
that I feel extreme confidence

1497
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,495
in the safety and the efficacy
of this vaccine

1498
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:35,956
and I want to encourage everyone
who has the opportunity

1499
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:40,085
to get vaccinated so that we can have
a veil of protection over this country

1500
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:41,921
that would end this pandemic.

1501
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,178
Thank you, Dr. Fauci
for coming today.

1502
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:54,308
- Any last minute questions, concerns?
- No.

1503
01:36:57,812 --> 01:36:59,230
Thank you so much.

1504
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,733
Bye, Dr. Fauci.

1505
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,777
<i>Dr. Fauci, you know him well,</i>

1506
01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:07,655
<i>getting this vaccine,
saying how important it is</i>

1507
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,740
<i>to show the American people it is safe.</i>

1508
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,618
<i>What a moment
for the man who played such a role</i>

1509
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:15,830
<i>in developing this vaccine,
to get the vaccine himself.</i>

1510
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,498
Excellent.

1511
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,792
<i>In March 2020,</i>

1512
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:22,795
<i>when we were first envisioning vaccines
for this coronavirus,</i>

1513
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:25,840
nobody thought that we would have them
by the end of the year.

1514
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:27,591
How do you feel, Tony?

1515
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,343
Nothing. Feeling good.

1516
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,804
- Feeling good.
- Excellent.

1517
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:34,974
<i>There have been many times
in previous administrations</i>

1518
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:37,560
<i>where people have not wanted
to fund the NIH quite as much</i>

1519
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:40,437
because they thought, "well,
this is just a bunch of scientists

1520
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,774
doing lab work.
How does that help the regular person?"

1521
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:45,776
This is how it helps the regular person.

1522
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:48,445
Thank you.

1523
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:59,331
<i>A public servant is somebody
who gives their skill,</i>

1524
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:05,296
<i>their intellect, their experience
to the people of the United States.</i>

1525
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,549
<i>You don't do it because you want
to make money,</i>

1526
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:13,012
you don't do it for the glory.
You do it because you care.

1527
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:54,303
<i>The two most devastating pandemics</i>

1528
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,971
<i>in the last 100 years</i>

1529
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:59,600
<i>are, sort of, like bookends on my career
and my life.</i>

1530
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:10,277
<i>When you're involved in a race
to stop a horrible disease...</i>

1531
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:17,117
you always feel you're not doing things
quickly enough... or well enough.

1532
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:29,129
<i>You know, it just reminds me so much
of when we were struggling</i>

1533
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:32,633
<i>to develop effective therapies for HIV.</i>

1534
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,972
If we had just gotten it

1535
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:40,975
a day earlier, a week earlier,
a month earlier...

1536
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,852
these number of people
would not have died.

1537
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:59,284
<i>One of the most mysterious aspects
of our universe</i>

1538
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:06,000
<i>is how viruses have transformed
our civilization.</i>

1539
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:16,427
<i>There was a Nobel Prize-winning
bacteriologist</i>

1540
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,432
<i>named Joshua Lederberg, who says,
"It's a never-ending battle</i>

1541
01:40:21,765 --> 01:40:27,146
<i>"between viruses'
spectacular genetic capability,</i>

1542
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:28,731
<i>"and our wits."</i>

1543
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:40,951
<i>As someone at my age
and my stage in life,</i>

1544
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:44,163
<i>it's natural to look ahead and say,</i>

1545
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,790
<i>"What are my children
gonna be faced with?"</i>

1546
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,587
And the one thing I can hope for...
really hope for,

1547
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:57,468
is that emerging infections
don't inevitably become pandemics.

1548
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:05,517
<i>I am optimistic that the lessons
that we've learned</i>

1549
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,020
<i>will prevent that from happening.</i>

1550
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,238
<i>I hope that if historians look back...</i>

1551
01:41:19,114 --> 01:41:22,076
if they ever would wanna look back...

1552
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:25,287
<i>at what I've done, and my life.</i>

1553
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:30,667
Maybe somebody says,
"Hey, that guy was pretty good."
