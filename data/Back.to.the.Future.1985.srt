<i>October is inventory time.</i>

2
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:34,294
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota
is making the best deals of the year...</i>

3
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,628
<i>on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

4
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,122
<i>You won't find a better car
at a better price...</i>

5
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:41,757
<i>with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

6
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:44,583
<i>That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.</i>

7
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,872
<i>But, hurry. This price is only good
through the end of the month.</i>

8
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,819
<i>The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.</i>

9
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:52,399
<i>In other news,</i>

10
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,976
<i>officials at the Pacific Nuclear
research facility have denied...</i>

11
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,718
<i>the rumor that a case of
missing plutonium was in fact...</i>

12
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,175
<i>stolen from their vault
two weeks ago.</i>

13
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,003
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

14
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:08,201
<i>However, officials now
attribute the discrepancy...</i>

15
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,019
<i>to a simple clerical error.</i>

16
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,620
<i>The FBI, which is
investigating the matter,</i>

17
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,539
<i>had no comment.</i>

18
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,248
Hey, Doc?

19
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,877
Doc?

20
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,722
Hello! Anybody home?

21
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,268
Einstein, come here, boy.

22
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:08,996
What's going on?
Oh, God!

23
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,296
Oh, Jesus!

24
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,767
That is disgusting.

25
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,908
Where the hell is he?

26
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,058
Whoa!

27
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:41,079
Rock 'n' roll.

28
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,602
- Yo.
<i>- Marty, is that you?</i>

29
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,164
Hey, hey, Doc.

30
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:53,983
- Where are you?
<i>- Thank God I've found you.</i>

31
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:56,618
<i>Listen, can you meet me
at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?</i>

32
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,289
<i>I made a major breakthrough,
and I need your assistance.</i>

33
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,460
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
1:15 in the morning?

34
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:02,414
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Doc, what's going on?

35
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,461
- Where you been all week?
<i>- Working.</i>

36
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,253
Where is Einstein?
Is he with you?

37
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:07,660
<i>Yeah, he's right here.</i>

38
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,448
You know Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

39
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,768
<i>My equipment?</i>

40
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,128
<i>That reminds me, Marty.</i>

41
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,956
<i>You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.</i>

42
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,229
Yeah.

43
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,104
- I'll keep that in mind.
<i>- Good.</i>

44
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:22,058
<i>I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.</i>

45
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,026
<i>- 1:15 A.M., Twin Pines Mall.</i>
- Right.

46
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,415
<i>Are those my clocks I hear?</i>

47
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:36,634
Yeah, it's 8 o'clock.

48
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,845
<i>Perfect!
My experiment worked.</i>

49
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:42,134
<i>They're all exactly 25 minutes slow.</i>

50
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:44,759
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.

51
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:47,418
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

52
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,775
<i>Precisely.</i>

53
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,384
Damn!

54
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,634
I'm late for school.

Oh, Jennifer.

70
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,732
Marty don't go this way.
Strickland's looking for you.

71
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:58,137
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

72
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,269
Alright, come on.
I think we're safe.

73
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:03,473
You know this time
it wasn't my fault.

74
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,051
The doc set all his clocks
25 minutes slow.

75
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,238
The doc?

76
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:11,590
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

77
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,730
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

78
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:18,651
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that makes four in a row.

79
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,717
Now, let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

80
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,092
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

81
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,576
You hang around with him,
you're gonna end up in big trouble.

82
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,357
Oh, yes, sir.

83
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,209
You got a real attitude problem, McFly.
You're a slacker.

84
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,139
You remind me of your father
when he went here.

85
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,295
He was a slacker, too.

86
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:39,678
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

87
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:43,654
I noticed your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

88
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,118
Why even bother, McFly?

89
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:48,001
You don't have a chance.
You're too much like your old man.

90
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,180
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

91
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,821
Yeah, well,
history is going to change.

92
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,189
Next, please.

93
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,785
Okay, let's rock 'n' roll.

94
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,540
Alright.

95
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:12,712
We're the...

96
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,797
We're the Pinheads.

97
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,164
One, two, three.

98
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,092
Okay, that's enough.

99
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,460
Thank you, fellas.
Hold it.

100
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,179
Hold it, fellas.

101
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:45,102
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

102
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:47,335
Next, please.

103
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,326
Where's the next group, please.

104
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:56,318
<i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

105
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:58,466
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

106
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,607
"Too loud."
I can't believe it.

107
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:03,271
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

108
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,807
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

109
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:08,201
Nah, I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

110
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,310
But, you're good, Marty.
You're really good.

111
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:12,264
And this audition tape
of yours is great.

112
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,341
You've got to send it in
to the record company.

113
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,170
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

114
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:19,310
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

115
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,686
That's good advice, Marty.

116
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,439
Alright, okay, Jennifer. What...

117
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,611
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

118
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,411
I mean, what if they say
I'm no good?

119
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,066
What if they say: Get out of here, kid.
You got no future?

120
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:33,177
I mean I just don't think
I can take that kind of rejection.

121
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,333
Jesus! I'm starting
to sound like my old man.

122
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:37,101
Come on, Marty,
it's not that bad.

123
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,302
At least, he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

124
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:43,640
Check out that 4x4.

125
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:45,225
That is hot.

126
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:46,851
Okay, back her up.

127
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,569
Someday, Jennifer.

128
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,304
Someday.

129
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:54,155
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

130
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:58,335
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

131
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,304
Lie out underneath the stars.

132
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:03,343
- Stop it.
- What?

133
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,382
Does your mom know?

134
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,765
About tomorrow night?

135
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:07,984
No, get out of town.

136
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,616
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

137
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,919
Look Jennifer, my mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

138
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:16,132
I'd get the standard lecture about...

139
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,398
how she never did that kind of stuff
when she was a kid.

140
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:19,484
I mean look...

141
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,491
I think the woman was born a nun.

142
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,998
She's just trying
to keep you respectable.

143
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,309
She's not doing a very good job.

144
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,536
Terrible.

145
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,685
Save the clock tower!

146
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,451
Save the clock tower.

147
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:35,427
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

148
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:38,191
Thirty years ago,
lightning struck that clock tower

149
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,021
and the clock hasn't run since.

150
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,652
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society think

151
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,933
it should be preserved
exactly the way it is.

152
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,245
- As part of our history and heritage.
- Here you go lady. Here's a quarter.

153
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,659
Thanks you.
Don't forget to take a flyer.

154
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:53,050
- Alright.
- Save the clock tower!

155
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,604
Where were we?

156
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,526
- Right about here.
- Jennifer!

157
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:03,213
- It's my dad.
- Right.

158
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:04,627
I've got to go.

159
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,908
I'll call you tonight.

160
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,455
Uh, I'll be at my grandma's.

161
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,127
Here, let me give you the number.

162
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:15,784
Bye.

Just perfect.

180
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,433
Listen, this isn't fun.

181
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,847
I can't believe,
you'd loan me your car,

182
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,948
without telling me it had a blind spot.

183
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,658
- Blind spot?
- I could've been killed.

184
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,254
Now, now, Biff, now,

185
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:29,418
I never noticed that the car had any
blind spot before when I would drive it.

186
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:30,770
Hi, son.

187
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,558
What, are you blind, McFly?

188
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,166
It's there. How else do you
explain that wreck out there?

189
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,410
Biff, um, can I, can I assume...

190
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:41,660
that your insurance is gonna
pay for the damage?

191
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:42,754
My insurance?

192
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:43,918
It's your car.

193
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:45,135
Your insurance should pay for.

194
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,872
I, I wanna know
who's gonna pay for this?

195
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,879
I spilled beer all over it
when that car smashed into me.

196
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,427
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

197
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,613
- Ah!
- And where's my reports?

198
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,835
Uh, well, I haven't
finished those up yet.

199
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,468
But, you know I, I figured
since they weren't due 'til--

200
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:58,593
Hello?

201
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,976
Hello, anybody home?
Huh?

202
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,445
- Think, McFly.
- Alright.

203
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:03,501
Think!

204
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:05,351
I got to have time
to get them retyped.

205
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:06,921
Uh, you realize
what would happen

206
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:09,671
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

207
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,335
I'll get fired.

208
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,890
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

209
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:16,296
- Would you?
- Of course not, Biff.

210
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,679
No I wouldn't want that to happen.

211
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,828
Now look. I'll finish
those reports tonight...

212
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,648
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, alright?

213
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,609
Hey, not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.

214
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,007
Look. Why your shoe's untied.

215
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,429
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

216
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,273
Got the place fixed up nice,
though, McFly.

217
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,843
I have your car towed
all the way to your house,

218
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:41,390
and all you got for me is lite beer?

219
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:50,300
What are you looking at, butthead?

220
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:54,808
Say hi to your mom for me.

221
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,666
I know what you're gonna say, son.

222
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:00,549
And you're right.

223
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,314
You're right.

224
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:04,213
But, uh...

225
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:07,533
Biff just happens to be
my supervisor and I'm...

226
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:11,965
afraid I'm just not very good
at confrontations.

227
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,879
But the car, Dad.

228
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:19,262
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

229
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,373
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

230
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:24,014
You have any idea
how important this was to me?

231
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,084
You have any clue?

232
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,951
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

233
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,787
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,389
Believe me, Marty.

235
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,357
You're better off without
having to worry about all the...

236
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:37,287
aggravation and headaches...

237
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,810
playing at that dance.

238
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,383
He's absolutely right, Marty.

239
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,584
The last thing you need
is headaches.

240
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,176
Kids?

241
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,981
We're gonna have to eat
this cake by ourselves.

242
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:58,293
Your Uncle Joey didn't make
parole again.

243
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:03,063
I think it would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

244
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,095
Uncle Jailbird Joey?

245
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,079
- He's your brother, Mom.
- Yeah.

246
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,665
I think it's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

247
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:12,777
We all make mistakes in life, children.

248
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,480
Goddamn it!
I'm late.

249
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,277
David, watch your mouth!

250
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,581
Come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

251
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,862
- Come here.
- Come on, Mom, make it fast.

252
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,487
I'll miss my bus.

253
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,003
See you later, Pop.

254
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,308
- Woo!
- What?

255
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:27,331
Time to change that oil.

256
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,880
Change that oil.

257
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,707
Hey, Marty.

258
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,702
I'm not your answering service.

259
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:36,088
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

260
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:38,409
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

261
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,965
I don't like her, Marty.

262
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,167
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

263
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,991
Oh, Mom, there is nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

264
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:47,881
I think it's terrible.

265
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,983
Girls chasing boys.

266
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,006
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy,

267
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,528
or called a boy, or...

268
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,397
sat in a parked car with a boy.

269
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,913
Then how am I ever supposed
to meet anybody?

270
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,561
Well, it'll just happen.

271
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,975
Like the way I met your father.

272
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,374
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

273
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,538
It was meant to be.

274
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,548
Anyway.

275
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,681
If Grandpa hadn't hit him,

276
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,470
then none of you
would have been born.

277
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,048
Yeah, well.

278
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,660
I still don't understand what Dad
was doing in the middle of the street.

279
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,011
What was it, George?

280
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,247
Bird-watching?

281
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,523
What, Lorraine?

282
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,816
What?

283
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:29,707
Anyway, your Grandpa hit him
with the car...

284
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,332
and brought him into the house.

285
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,636
He seemed so helpless.

286
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,263
Like a little lost puppy.

287
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,724
- And my heart just went out to him.
- Yeah, Mom, we know.

288
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,800
You've told us this story
a million times.

289
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,357
You felt sorry for him.

290
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,554
So, you decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

291
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,272
No, no. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

292
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,171
Our first date.

293
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,077
I'll never forget it.

294
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:59,780
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember George?

295
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:07,165
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

296
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,377
And then, it was then
that I realized...

297
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,602
that I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with him.

298
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,798
Oh, no.

299
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:43,546
Hello.

300
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,149
<i>Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</i>

301
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,822
No, uh, Doc.

302
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,462
Uh, no.

303
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,391
No, don't, don't be silly.

304
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,056
<i>Listen, this is very important.</i>

305
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,353
<i>I forgot my video camera.</i>

306
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:56,095
<i>Can you stop by my place and
pick it up on your way to the mall?</i>

307
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,540
Uh, yeah.

308
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,962
I'm, I'm on my way.

309
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,416
Einstein!

310
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:26,416
Hey, Einstein!
Where's the doc, boy?

311
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,619
Huh?

312
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,013
Doc!

313
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:23,942
Marty!

314
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,455
- You made it.
- Yeah.

315
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,998
Welcome to my latest experiment.

316
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:29,545
This is the big one, the one
I've been waiting for all my life.

317
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,264
Uh, well, it's a DeLorean, right?

318
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,171
Bear with me, Marty.
All your questions will be answered.

319
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:34,721
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

320
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,416
Uh, Doc?
Uh, is that a Devo suit?

321
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:39,361
Never mind that now,
never mind that now. Not now, not now.

322
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,851
Alright, I'm ready.

323
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,687
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

324
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,917
I'm standing on the parking lot
at Twin Pines Mall.

325
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:48,523
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

326
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,843
And this is temporal experiment
number one.

327
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,015
Come on, on, Einie.

328
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,077
Hey, hey, boy, get in there.
That a boy!

329
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:55,945
In there, you go.
Sit down.

330
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,406
Put your seatbelt on.
That's it.

331
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,890
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay.

332
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,226
Please note...

333
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:09,554
that Einstein's clock,

334
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,452
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

335
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,038
- Got it?
- Right. Check, Doc.

336
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,429
Good.

337
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,820
Have a good trip, Einstein.

338
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,976
Watch your head.

339
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,869
You got that thing
hooked up to the...

340
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,369
- car?
- Watch this.

341
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,768
Yeah. Okay.

342
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,133
Got it.

343
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:37,418
Jesus!

344
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:44,420
Not me!
The car. the car!

345
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,589
If my calculations are correct,

346
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,847
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour,

347
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,878
you're gonna see some serious shit.

348
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,223
Watch this, watch this!

349
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,106
What did I tell you?

350
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:12,098
88 miles per hour!

351
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:19,496
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m and 0 seconds!

352
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,348
Hot! Jesus Christ!

353
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,965
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You just disintegrated Einstein.

354
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,551
Calm down, Marty.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

355
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:32,153
The molecular structure of both
Einstein and the car are completely intact.

356
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:33,839
Then where the hell are they?

357
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:35,419
The appropriate question is...

358
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,067
When the hell are they?

359
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:41,927
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

360
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:45,474
I sent him into the future.

361
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:48,067
One minute into the future,
to be exact.

362
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:51,296
At precisely 1:21 a.m and 0 seconds,

363
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:55,192
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

364
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,757
Wait a minute.

365
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,132
Wait a minute, Doc.

366
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,341
Uh...

367
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:04,702
Are you telling me,
you built a time machine...

368
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,843
out of a DeLorean?

369
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:07,921
The way I see it,

370
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,968
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

371
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:11,669
why not do it in some style?

372
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:16,124
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

373
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:18,204
Look out!

374
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,153
What? What?
Is it hot?

375
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,503
It's cold. Damn cold.

376
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:12,519
Einstein, you little devil!

377
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:18,550
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

378
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:23,011
- He's alright.
- He's fine.

379
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,277
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

380
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:28,066
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

381
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,636
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

382
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,784
He skipped over that minute
to instantly arrive at this moment in time.

383
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:34,839
Come here.

384
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,206
- I'll show you how it works.
- Alright.

385
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:39,603
First,

386
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:42,580
you turn the time circuits on.

387
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:46,705
This readout tells you
where you're going.

388
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,088
This one tells you where you are.

389
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,674
This one tells you where you were.

390
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,996
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

391
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,527
Say you wanna see the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

392
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:00,277
Or witness the birth of Christ.

393
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,480
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

394
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,527
November 5, 1955.

395
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,561
Yes, of course.

396
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,038
November 5, 1955.

397
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,444
Why? I don't get it.
What happened?

398
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,647
That was the day
I invented time travel.

399
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,368
I remember it vividly.

400
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:26,651
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

401
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:29,485
The porcelain was wet, I slipped,
hit my head on the edge of the sink.

402
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,463
And when I came to,
I had a revelation.

403
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,947
A vision.
A picture in my head.

404
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:35,604
A picture of this.

405
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,815
This is what makes time travel possible.

406
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:40,807
The flux capacitor.

407
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:42,291
Flux capacitor?

408
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:44,845
It's taken almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune...

409
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,049
to realize the vision of that day.

410
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,947
My God, has it been that long?

411
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:53,166
Things have certainly changed
around here.

412
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:58,549
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

413
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,572
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

414
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:04,994
He had this crazy idea...

415
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:07,447
about breeding pine trees.

416
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:12,041
This is, uh...

417
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,284
this is heavy-duty, Doc.
This is great.

418
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,276
Uh, does it run like on regular
unleaded gasoline?

419
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:18,366
Unfortunately, no.

420
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,151
It requires something
with a little more kick.

421
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:21,213
Plutonium.

422
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:23,526
Uh, plutonium.
Wait a minute. Are you...

423
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,018
are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

424
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,112
Hey, hey, hey!
Keep rolling, keep rolling there.

425
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:30,002
No, no, no, no.
This sucker's electrical.

426
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,354
But, I need a nuclear reaction...

427
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:33,964
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

428
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:37,877
Doc, you don't just walk
into a store and, and buy plutonium.

429
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,080
Did you rip that off?

430
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,533
Of course, from a group
of Libyan Nationalists.

431
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:45,787
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

432
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:46,973
So, I took their plutonium...

433
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,115
and in turn gave them a shoddy bomb
casing full of used pinball machine parts.

434
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,208
- Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

435
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,162
We must prepare to reload.

436
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:25,556
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.

437
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,041
Don't you lose those tapes now.

438
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,174
I need that as a record.

439
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,408
Let's put this back in here.
There we go.

440
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:36,153
Wait! Oh!

441
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:37,822
Almost forgot my luggage.

442
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,541
I mean, who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

443
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,354
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

444
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,158
The future?

445
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,885
- That's where you're going.
- That's right.

446
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,244
25 years into the future.

447
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:50,127
I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years,

448
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,408
seeing the progress of mankind.

449
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,744
Why not?

450
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,504
I'll also be able to see who wins
the next 25 World Series.

451
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:00,051
- Uh, Doc?
- Huh?

452
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:03,231
Uh, look me up
when you get there.

453
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:04,926
Indeed I will.

454
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:06,535
Roll them.

455
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:13,650
I...

456
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:15,704
Dr. Emmett Brown...

457
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,016
am about to embark
on an historic journey.

458
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,899
What am I thinking of?

459
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,453
I almost forgot to bring
extra plutonium.

460
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:26,969
How do I ever expect to get back?

461
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:30,282
One pellet, one trip.
I must be out of my mind.

462
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,426
What is it, Einie?

463
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,308
Oh, my God!

464
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,153
They found me. I don't know how,
but they found me.

465
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,567
Run for it, Marty!

466
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:49,888
Who? Who?

467
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,948
Who do you think?
The Libyans!

468
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:55,768
Over there!
Over there.

469
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,635
Holy shit!

470
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,036
I'll draw their fire!

471
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:12,642
Doc, wait!

472
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:29,016
No!

473
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,979
You bastard!

474
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,720
Go!

475
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,752
Damn Soviet gun.

476
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:57,929
Go!

477
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:39,616
Come on, move!

478
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,358
Uh, damn it!

479
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,530
Jesus!

480
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,228
Holy shit!

481
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:08,850
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

482
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,479
What, what is it?

483
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,409
W-What is it, Pa?

484
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:05,487
Looks like an airplane.

485
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,261
Without wings.

486
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,290
That ain't no airplane.

487
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,760
Look.

488
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:32,414
Don't look!

489
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,399
Listen! Oh!

490
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,956
Hello.

491
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:50,690
Uh.

492
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,549
Excuse me.

493
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,344
Sorry about your barn.

494
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,891
It's already mutated
into the human form.

495
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:04,438
Shoot it!

496
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,783
Take that,
you mutated son of a bitch!

497
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,072
Wait!

498
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:18,496
Oh, we will, oh!

499
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:21,676
My pine!

500
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:23,887
Why you...

501
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:27,110
You space bastard!

502
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:29,509
You killed our pine!

503
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,071
You're fine, you're fine.
Okay, McFly.

504
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:37,360
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

505
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,485
It's just a very intense dream.

506
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,226
Whoa, whoa.

507
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:28,335
- Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

508
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,913
It can't be.

509
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,383
This is nuts.

510
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,688
Come on.

511
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,157
Perfect.

537
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,509
Hey, kid.

538
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,416
What you do?
Jump ship?

539
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:31,533
What?

540
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,236
What's with the life preserver?

541
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:40,378
I just want to use the phone.

542
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,698
Yeah, it's in the back.

543
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,299
Brown.

544
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:49,284
Great.

545
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,034
You're alive.

546
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,477
Come on.

547
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:15,455
- Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
- You gonna order something, kid?

548
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,017
Uh, yeah.

549
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,900
Give me, give me a tab.

550
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,456
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

551
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,558
Right.
Give me a Pepsi Free.

552
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:27,324
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're gonna pay for it.

553
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:30,667
Well, just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

554
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,792
Something without sugar.

555
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:42,131
Hey, McFly.

556
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,155
What do you think you're doing?

557
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:47,829
Biff.

558
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:50,630
Hey, I'm talking to you McFly,
you Irish bug!

559
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,960
Oh, hey, Biff. Hey, guys.
How are you doing?

560
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,548
You got my homework finished, McFly?

561
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,967
Uh, well actually, I figured,
since it wasn't due 'til Monday--

562
00:38:57,992 --> 00:39:00,766
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

563
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,376
Hey, think, McFly. Think.

564
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:05,379
I got to have time to recopy it.

565
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:09,015
You realize what would happen if
I hand in my homework in your handwriting?

566
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,867
I'll get kicked out of school.

567
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:14,060
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

568
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,343
- Would you?
- Now, of course not, Biff.

569
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,430
- No, no.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

570
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:21,089
What are you looking at, butthead?

571
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,417
Hey, Biff, get a load of
this guy's life preserver.

572
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,198
- Dork thinks he's gonna drown.
- Yeah.

573
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,206
Yeah, well, how about
my homework, McFly?

574
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:30,159
Uh, okay, Biff.
Well, I'll, uh...

575
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:31,712
I'll finish that one up tonight...

576
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,925
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

577
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:36,745
Hey, not too early.
I sleep in Sunday.

578
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:38,121
Oh McFly, your shoe's untied!

579
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:39,253
Oh, ah, ah!

580
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:41,362
- Don't be so gullible, McFly.
- Okay.

581
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,292
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay.

582
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,636
Alright. Bye-bye.

583
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:07,981
What?

584
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,863
You're George McFly!

585
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:11,363
Yeah. And who are you?

586
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,551
Say! Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

587
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,043
Well, they're bigger than me.

588
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:18,752
Stand tall, boy.
Have some respect for yourself.

589
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:20,988
Don't you know,
if you let people walk over you now,

590
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,145
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

591
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,184
Look at me.

592
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,449
You think I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in this slop house?

593
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,285
- Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir.

594
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,988
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school.

595
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,137
And one day,
I'm going to be somebody.

596
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,082
That's right.
He's going to be mayor.

597
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:36,771
Yeah, I'm...

598
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,926
Mayor!

599
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,527
Now, that's a good idea.

600
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,145
I could run for mayor.

601
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:44,934
A colored mayor.
That'll be the day.

602
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,371
You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers.
I will be mayor.

603
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,731
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley.

604
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,629
And I'm going to clean up this town.

605
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,027
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

606
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,163
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

607
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:02,187
I like the sound of that.

608
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,540
Hey, Dad!
George!

609
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey, you on the bike!

610
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,873
He's a peeping Tom.

611
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,460
Dad!

612
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,115
Hey, wait.

613
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,212
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

614
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,228
Stella!

615
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:18,970
Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

616
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:22,275
Come on out here!
Help me take him in the house!

617
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:28,798
Mom?

618
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:30,610
That you?

619
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:32,556
There, there, now.

620
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:34,737
Just relax.

621
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:40,212
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

622
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,587
Yeah.

623
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:44,743
I had a horrible nightmare.

624
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,642
I dreamed that I went...

625
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:48,384
back in time.

626
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,157
It was terrible.

627
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,102
Well...

628
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,673
you're safe and sound now,
back in good old 1955.

629
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:59,110
1955?

630
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:04,668
You're my mo--

631
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,051
You're my mo--

632
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,989
My name is Lorraine.

633
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:10,278
Lorraine Baines?

634
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:11,910
Yeah.

635
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,754
But, you're--

636
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,364
You're so uh...

637
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,098
You're so...

638
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:18,988
Thin!

639
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:22,301
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

640
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,140
Ah!

641
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:28,266
Where are my pants?

642
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:30,164
Over there.

643
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,508
On my hope chest.

644
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,367
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

645
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,766
Calvin? Why, why you keep
calling me Calvin?

646
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:41,297
That is your name, isn't it?

647
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:43,048
Calvin Klein?

648
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:46,008
It's written all over your underwear.

649
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,696
Oh, I guess they call you Cal?

650
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,110
No, actually, people...

651
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,125
call me Marty.

652
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,657
Oh.

653
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:57,282
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

654
00:43:58,024 --> 00:43:59,828
Marty.

655
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,664
Klein.

656
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:10,856
Do you mind if I sit here?

657
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:12,341
No. Fine.

658
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,091
No. Good. Fine.

659
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:15,489
Good.

660
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:19,064
That's, uh, a big bruise
you have there.

661
00:44:20,384 --> 00:44:22,908
- Oh!
- Lorraine, are you up there?

662
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:24,869
Oh, my God!
It's my mother.

663
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:26,361
Quick.

664
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,994
Put your pants back on.

665
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,943
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

666
00:44:38,998 --> 00:44:41,443
- Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you?

667
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,466
That's why you wear
that life preserver.

668
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:45,209
Uh, coast guard.

669
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,387
Sam?

670
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:48,763
Here's the young man you hit
with your car out there.

671
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,099
He's alright.
Thank God.

672
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:52,006
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

673
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,154
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

674
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:57,273
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

675
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,390
Now, let's see.
You already know Lorraine.

676
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:02,059
This is Milton.
This is Sally.

677
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,320
That's Toby.

678
00:45:03,348 --> 00:45:07,020
And over there in the playpen
is little baby, Joey.

679
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:10,637
So, you're my uncle Joey.

680
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,325
Better get used to these bars, kid.

681
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:17,996
Yes, Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

682
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:21,481
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we just leave him in there all the time.

683
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,957
Well, Marty,
I hope you like meatloaf.

684
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:26,184
Well, listen,
I really ought to--

685
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:27,739
Sit here, Marty.

686
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:32,280
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

687
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:34,217
Oh oh oh!

688
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,873
Look at it roll.

689
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:38,420
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

690
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:48,835
Our first television set.

691
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:51,080
Dad just picked it up today.

692
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:53,346
Do you have a television?

693
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:55,298
Well, yeah.
You know, we have...

694
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:56,565
two of them.

695
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:57,768
Wow!

696
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,401
You must be rich.

697
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:03,651
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

698
00:46:03,682 --> 00:46:05,002
Mm.

699
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,523
Hey.

700
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:12,437
Hey, I've seen this one.
I've seen this one, it's a classic.

701
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:15,633
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

702
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:17,687
What do you mean, you've seen this?

703
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:19,155
It's brand-new.

704
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,125
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

705
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,969
What's a rerun?

706
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:25,711
You'll find out.

707
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,484
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

708
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:30,719
Do I know your mother?

709
00:46:31,406 --> 00:46:33,492
Yeah, I think, maybe, you do.

710
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,984
Oh, then, I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.

711
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,320
You can't.

712
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:41,570
Uh, that is,
uh, nobody, uh...

713
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,500
nobody's home.

714
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:45,039
Oh.

715
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:46,789
Yet.

716
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:48,352
Oh.

717
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:49,844
Uh, listen.

718
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,625
You, you know where
Riverside Drive is?

719
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:55,187
It's on the other end of town,
a block past Maple.

720
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,742
East end of town.

721
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,320
Wait a minute,
a block past Maple.

722
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,156
That's, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.

723
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:03,367
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

724
00:47:03,397 --> 00:47:05,375
Um, mother? Uh...

725
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:08,641
With Marty's parents out of town,

726
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:11,237
don't you think
he ought to spend the night?

727
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:13,891
I mean after all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

728
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:15,891
That's true, Marty.

729
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:19,439
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

730
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,994
Well, gee, I don't know.

731
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,290
And he can sleep in my room.

732
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:25,501
I gotta go!
Uh, I gotta go.

733
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:27,806
Thanks very much, it was wonderful.
You're all great.

734
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,798
Uh, see you all later.

735
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:32,165
Too much later.

736
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:38,503
He's a very strange young man.

737
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:40,097
He's an idiot.

738
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:41,581
Comes from upbringing.

739
00:47:41,631 --> 00:47:44,026
His parents are probably idiots, too.

740
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:47,956
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

741
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:27,399
Doc?

742
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,774
Don't say a word.

743
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:31,905
- Doc.
- I don't wanna know your name.

744
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,210
I don't want to know
anything bout you.

745
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,530
- Listen, Doc.
- Quiet!

746
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:36,602
- Doc, doc, it's me, Marty.
- Don't tell me anything.

747
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:38,930
- Doc, you got to help--
- Quiet! Quiet.

748
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,456
I'm gonna read your thoughts.

749
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:47,222
Let's see now.
You've come here from a great distance?

750
00:48:47,277 --> 00:48:49,456
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Now, don't tell me!

751
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,113
Uh, you want me to buy a subscription
to the Saturday Evening Post.

752
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,316
- No.
- Not a word.

753
00:48:54,355 --> 00:48:55,838
Not a word.
Not a word now!

754
00:48:55,863 --> 00:48:57,230
Quiet.

755
00:48:57,278 --> 00:48:58,966
Uh.

756
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,519
Toys.

757
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:02,581
You want me to make a donation...

758
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:05,546
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

759
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,013
Doc.

760
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:10,420
I'm from the future.

761
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:14,193
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

762
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,865
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

763
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:22,209
My God.

764
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:29,392
Do you know what this means?

765
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:34,642
It means that this damn thing
doesn't work at all!

766
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,049
- Shit! Fuck!
- Doc, you got to help me.

767
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,978
You are the only one who knows
how your time machine works.

768
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:40,736
Time machine?

769
00:49:41,072 --> 00:49:43,931
I haven't invented any time machine.

770
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,135
Okay. Alright.
I'll prove it to you.

771
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:48,791
Look at my driver's license.

772
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,588
Expires 1987?

773
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,244
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

774
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,260
I haven't even been born yet.

775
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:56,619
And look at this picture.

776
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,744
My brother, my sister, and me.

777
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,494
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.

778
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,705
Class of 1984?

779
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,153
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

780
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:07,364
They cut off your brother's hair.

781
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,270
I'm telling the truth, Doc.
You got to believe me.

782
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,567
Then tell me...

783
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,559
future boy.

784
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:17,754
Who's President of
the United States in 1985?

785
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:18,927
Ronald Reagan.

786
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:20,098
Ronald Reagan?

787
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:21,551
The actor?

788
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:26,058
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?

789
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:28,308
I suppose Jane Wyman...

790
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:30,330
- is the First Lady.
- Whoa, wait, Doc!

791
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,565
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

792
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,096
- Ha!
- Doc, you gotta listen to me.

793
00:50:34,121 --> 00:50:36,189
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

794
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:37,501
Good night, future boy!

795
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:38,893
No, wait, Doc.
Doc.

796
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:41,689
The, the bruise, the bruise on your head.
I know how that happened.

797
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:43,314
You told me the whole story.

798
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:44,792
You were standing on your toilet,

799
00:50:44,817 --> 00:50:46,634
and you were hanging a clock,
and you fell,

800
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:48,229
and you hit your head on the sink.

801
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:51,245
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

802
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:55,690
which is what makes
time travel possible.

803
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:10,543
There's something wrong
with the starter.

804
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:11,886
So, I hid it...

805
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:13,378
here.

806
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:25,544
After I fell off my toilet,

807
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,646
I drew this.

808
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,154
The flux capacitor.

809
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:52,720
It works!

810
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:56,689
It works!

811
00:51:57,634 --> 00:52:00,892
I finally invent something that works!

812
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,392
You bet your ass it works.

813
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:06,923
Somehow, we've got to sneak this
back to my laboratory.

814
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:09,478
We've got to get you home.

815
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,697
Okay, Doc, this is it.

816
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:14,761
<i>Never mind that.
Never mind that now.</i>

817
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:17,213
<i>- Never mind that, you're fine.</i>
- Why, that's me!

818
00:52:17,245 --> 00:52:19,128
Look at me!
I'm an old man.

819
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:20,277
<i>Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

820
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:21,589
<i>I'm standing on the...</i>

821
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:24,527
<i>- parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.</i>
- Thank God, I've still got my hair.

822
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:26,551
And what's on Earth
is this thing I'm wearing?

823
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,933
Why, this, this is a radiation suit.

824
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,589
Radiation suit?

825
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:31,891
Of course.

826
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,769
Because of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

827
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:36,691
This...

828
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,199
is truly amazing.

829
00:52:38,278 --> 00:52:41,074
A portable television studio.

830
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:42,808
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

831
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,824
He's gotta look good on television.

832
00:52:44,886 --> 00:52:47,605
Whoa, this is it.
This is the part coming up, Doc.

833
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,628
<i>No, no, no, no.
This sucker's electrical.</i>

834
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,852
<i>But, I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts--</i>

835
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:54,706
What did I just say?

836
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,620
<i>This sucker's electrical.</i>

837
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,698
<i>but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts--</i>

838
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:05,856
<i>- of electricity I need.</i>
- 1.21 gigawatts!

839
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:09,785
1.21 gigawatts.

840
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:12,919
Great Scott!

841
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,702
What?

842
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:17,382
What the hell is a gigawatt?

843
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:19,921
How could I have been so careless?

844
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:22,030
1.21 gigawatts!

845
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:24,706
Tom, how am I going
to generate that kind of power?

846
00:53:24,731 --> 00:53:26,428
It can't be done, can it?

847
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,921
Doc, look.

848
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:29,757
All we need is a little plutonium.

849
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:32,194
Oh, I'm sure that in 1985,

850
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:34,444
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore.

851
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,350
but in 1955,
it's a little hard to come by.

852
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:41,022
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

853
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:42,842
Whoa, whoa, Doc.
Stuck here?

854
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:46,455
I can't, I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in, in 1985.

855
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,717
I got a girl.

856
00:53:47,755 --> 00:53:49,069
Is she pretty?

857
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:51,428
Doc, she's beautiful. She...

858
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,212
she's crazy about me.

859
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:55,399
Look at this.
Look what she wrote here, Doc.

860
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:57,868
I mean, that says it all.

861
00:53:58,717 --> 00:54:00,108
Doc...

862
00:54:00,257 --> 00:54:01,960
you're my only hope.

863
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,430
Marty, I'm sorry.

864
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:05,524
But, the only power source
capable of generating...

865
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:09,485
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

866
00:54:10,008 --> 00:54:12,399
- What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

867
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:16,156
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever gonna strike.

868
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:19,899
We do now.

869
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,182
This is it!

870
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,791
This is the answer.

871
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:30,393
It says here,

872
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:32,635
that a bolt of lightning is gonna
strike the clock tower

873
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,690
at precisely 10:04 p.m
next Saturday night.

874
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:40,959
If we could, somehow,

875
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:43,592
harness this lightning,

876
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:45,264
channel it...

877
00:54:45,304 --> 00:54:48,123
into the flux capacitor,

878
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:50,420
it just might work.

879
00:54:50,592 --> 00:54:52,295
Next Saturday night,

880
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:55,553
we're sending you back to the future!

881
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,631
Okay, alright.

882
00:54:56,656 --> 00:54:58,014
Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

883
00:54:58,039 --> 00:54:59,716
I can spend a week in 1955.

884
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:01,538
We can hang out.
You can show me around.

885
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:03,459
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

886
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:04,850
You must not leave this house.

887
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,952
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

888
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:09,600
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

889
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:11,584
Do you understand?

890
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:14,624
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

891
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,249
Marty?

892
00:55:16,389 --> 00:55:19,866
You interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

893
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,506
I, um...

894
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:24,749
Yeah, well, I might have
sort of bumped in to my parents.

895
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:26,397
Great Scott!

896
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:28,827
Let me see that photograph again
of your brother.

897
00:55:28,874 --> 00:55:30,546
Uh.

898
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,428
Just as I thought.

899
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:36,225
This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

900
00:55:36,725 --> 00:55:38,217
His head's gone.

901
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:40,897
It's like, it's like it's been erased.

902
00:55:41,577 --> 00:55:44,741
Erased from existence.

903
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:49,436
Whoa!

904
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:51,334
They really cleaned this place up.

905
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,522
Looks brand-new.

906
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:54,194
Now, remember.
According to my theory,

907
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:56,037
you interfered with
your parents' first meeting.

908
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:57,287
They don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

909
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,045
they won't get married,
and they won't have kids.

910
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:01,592
That's why your older brother's
disappearing from that photograph.

911
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,873
Your sister will follow,
and unless you repair the damage,

912
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:05,022
you'll be next.

913
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:07,811
- Sounds pretty heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

914
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:10,405
Which one's your pop?

915
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,834
That's him.

916
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:15,639
Okay, okay, you guys.

917
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:18,286
Oh, ha ha ha!
Very funny.

918
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,505
You guys are being real mature.

919
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:22,368
Maybe, you were adopted.

920
00:56:22,393 --> 00:56:25,336
Okay, real mature, guys.

921
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:28,024
Okay, please.
Will you pick up my books?

922
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:30,321
- McFly.
- Look, that's Strickland.

923
00:56:30,493 --> 00:56:32,641
Jesus!
Didn't that guy ever have hair?

924
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:34,243
Shape up, man.

925
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:35,625
You're a slacker.

926
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:38,508
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

927
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,079
No.

928
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,782
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

929
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:43,172
I don't know, Doc.
Come on.

930
00:56:43,197 --> 00:56:47,407
I, I guess she felt sorry for him
because her dad hit him with the car.

931
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:49,922
Hit me with the car.

932
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:51,993
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

933
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:55,188
It happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients.

934
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,118
Go to it, kid.

935
00:56:57,438 --> 00:56:59,438
Hey, George.

936
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,853
Buddy.

937
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:03,375
I have been looking all over for you.

938
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:06,524
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

939
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:08,727
- Oh. Yeah.
- Good.

940
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:11,188
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

941
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,586
Lorraine?

942
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,915
Calvin!

943
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:22,165
I'd like you to meet my good friend,
George McFly.

944
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:23,594
Hi.

945
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:26,313
It's really a pleasure to meet you.

946
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:29,079
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

947
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,094
Oh, I've been so worried about you

948
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,040
ever since you ran off the other night.

949
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:34,813
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

950
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:37,130
- Come on, the party.
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

951
00:57:37,155 --> 00:57:39,024
Come on!

952
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:41,665
Isn't he a dreamboat?

953
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:46,794
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

954
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:48,387
This is more serious than I thought.

955
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:50,669
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

956
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:52,458
instead of your father.

957
00:57:52,614 --> 00:57:54,005
Whoa! Wait, wait a minute, Doc.

958
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,958
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother...

959
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,622
has got the hots for me?

960
00:57:57,647 --> 00:57:58,778
Precisely.

961
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,411
Whoa, this is heavy.

962
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:02,528
There's that word again, "Heavy".

963
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:04,153
Why are things so heavy in the future?

964
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:06,380
Is there a problem with
the Earth's gravitational pull?

965
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:07,536
- What?
- The only way...

966
00:58:07,561 --> 00:58:10,325
we're gonna get those two to successfully
mate is if they're alone together.

967
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,965
So, you've got to get your father
and mother to interact.

968
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,676
Some sort of social--

969
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:18,192
Well, what?
You mean like a date?

970
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,053
- Right!
- What kind of date?

971
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:22,153
I don't know.
What do kids do in the '50s?

972
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:24,833
What? They're your parents.
You must know them.

973
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:28,442
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

974
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:30,333
Nothing.

975
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:31,442
Look!

976
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,551
There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

977
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,739
Of course, the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

978
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:37,090
They're supposed to go to this.

979
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:38,957
That's where they kiss for the first time.

980
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:40,293
Alright, kid.

981
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,034
You stick to your father like glue,

982
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,246
and make sure
he takes her to that dance.

983
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:46,387
George, buddy.

984
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:48,879
Remember that girl
I introduced you to?

985
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:50,645
Lorraine?

986
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:57,434
What are you writing?

987
00:58:57,536 --> 00:58:58,684
Uh.

988
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:00,270
Stories.

989
00:59:00,356 --> 00:59:03,153
Science fiction stories about...

990
00:59:03,215 --> 00:59:04,482
visitors,

991
00:59:04,528 --> 00:59:06,012
coming down to Earth,

992
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:08,575
from other planets.

993
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:11,246
Get out of town!

994
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:13,762
I didn't know
you did anything creative.

995
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:15,145
Well, let me read some.

996
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,715
Oh, no, no, no, no.

997
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:20,051
I never, I never let
anybody read my stories.

998
00:59:20,278 --> 00:59:21,817
Why not?

999
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:26,996
Well, what if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

1000
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:32,114
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

1001
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:33,918
Uh, no.

1002
00:59:33,977 --> 00:59:36,176
No, not hard at all.

1003
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,926
So anyway, George.

1004
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,925
About Lorraine.

1005
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:42,387
She really likes you.

1006
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:46,348
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

1007
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,973
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

1008
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:49,192
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1009
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:52,584
All you got to do
is go over there and ask her.

1010
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,410
What? Right here,
right now in the cafeteria?

1011
00:59:55,442 --> 00:59:56,621
What if she said no?

1012
00:59:56,649 --> 00:59:59,879
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

1013
01:00:00,692 --> 01:00:02,160
Besides,

1014
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:05,777
I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

1015
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:07,910
Uh, who?

1016
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,637
Biff.

1017
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:12,957
Don't kid around.
Come on.

1018
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:15,034
- I'm gonna leave.
- What? You want it.

1019
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,284
You know you want it.

1020
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:18,301
You know you want me
to give it to you.

1021
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:21,121
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

1022
01:00:21,146 --> 01:00:22,340
Oh, woo, woo!

1023
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,004
Maybe, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

1024
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,910
Get your meat hooks off of me.

1025
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,254
You heard her.

1026
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:30,590
She said, get your meat hooks...

1027
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,129
off.

1028
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:34,270
Uh, please.

1029
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:37,020
So, what's it to you, butthead?

1030
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:40,013
You know,
you've been looking for a fight.

1031
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:41,256
- Alright!
- Fight!

1032
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:42,712
Quiet!

1033
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:51,895
Since you're new here,

1034
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:53,802
I'm gonna cut you a break,

1035
01:00:53,919 --> 01:00:55,364
today.

1036
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,739
So, why don't you make like a tree,

1037
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:00,762
and get out of here.

1038
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:14,288
George!

1039
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,359
Why do you keep following me around?

1040
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,921
Look, George.

1041
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,445
I'm telling you, George.

1042
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:22,302
If you do not ask Lorraine
to that dance,

1043
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:23,951
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

1044
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,406
But, I can't go to the dance.

1045
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,593
I'll miss my favorite television program,
Science Fiction Theatre.

1046
01:01:28,624 --> 01:01:29,820
Yeah, but, George...

1047
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:32,124
Lorraine wants to go with you.

1048
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:33,275
Give her a break.

1049
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,498
Look, I'm just not ready,

1050
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:38,062
to ask Lorraine out to the dance.

1051
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:39,476
And not you...

1052
01:01:39,527 --> 01:01:41,507
or anybody else on this planet

1053
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,134
is gonna make me change my mind.

1054
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:53,451
Science Fiction Theatre.

1055
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:25,635
Who are you?

1056
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:33,658
Silence, Earthling.

1057
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:37,729
My name is Darth Vader.

1058
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:46,135
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

1059
01:02:47,478 --> 01:02:48,809
Marty!

1060
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:50,684
Watch out!

1061
01:02:50,723 --> 01:02:51,817
Hey!

1062
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:52,894
Marty!

1063
01:02:52,919 --> 01:02:54,488
- Marty.
- Hey, George, buddy.

1064
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,699
You weren't at school.
What've you been doing all day?

1065
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,131
I overslept.

1066
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,832
Look, I need your help.

1067
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:02,565
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

1068
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,308
Alright. Okay, listen, keep your pants on.
She's over in the cafe.

1069
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,027
God!
How do you--?

1070
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:12,012
What made you
change your mind, George?

1071
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:14,164
Last night,
Darth Vader came down...

1072
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,074
from Planet Vulcan and told me that
if I didn't take Lorraine out,

1073
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,316
that he'd melt my brain.

1074
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:20,148
Yeah, well, uh, let's,
let's just keep this...

1075
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:22,219
brain melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

1076
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,250
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Alright, okay.

1077
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:25,750
Alright.
There she is, George.

1078
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:27,608
Now, just go in there and invite her.

1079
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,377
Okay. But,
I don't know what to say.

1080
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:30,499
Just say anything, George.

1081
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:31,643
Say whatever's natural,

1082
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:34,416
or the first thing
that comes into your mind.

1083
01:03:34,986 --> 01:03:36,994
Nothing's coming to my mind.

1084
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,908
Jesus, George!
It's a wonder I was even born.

1085
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,814
- What? What?
- Nothing, nothing.

1086
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:42,018
Nothing.

1087
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:43,213
Look.

1088
01:03:43,314 --> 01:03:45,002
Tell her destiny...

1089
01:03:45,057 --> 01:03:46,172
brought you together.

1090
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,205
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl...

1091
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:49,960
you've ever seen in the world.

1092
01:03:50,072 --> 01:03:51,932
Girls like that stuff.

1093
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:53,296
What are you doing, George?

1094
01:03:53,323 --> 01:03:55,335
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

1095
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,468
- Yeah. Okay.
- Oh.

1096
01:03:56,493 --> 01:03:57,296
- Let's go.
- Oh.

1097
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:59,064
- Can you take care of that?
- Alright.

1098
01:04:16,863 --> 01:04:18,417
Lou?

1099
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:20,941
Give me a milk.

1100
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,745
Chocolate.

1101
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:40,336
Lorraine.

1102
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,367
My density...

1103
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,672
has popped me to you.

1104
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:46,491
What?

1105
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,049
Oh.

1106
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,361
What I meant to say...

1107
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:52,229
- was...
- Wait a minute.

1108
01:04:52,254 --> 01:04:54,533
Don't I know you from somewhere?

1109
01:04:54,611 --> 01:04:56,041
Yes.

1110
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,518
Yes. I'm George.

1111
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,549
George McFly.

1112
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,799
I'm your density.

1113
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:05,041
I mean...

1114
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:08,041
your destiny.

1115
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,299
Oh.

1116
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,417
Hey, McFly.

1117
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:15,479
Geez!

1118
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:19,229
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

1119
01:05:21,732 --> 01:05:24,030
Well, it's gonna cost you.

1120
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,826
How much money you got on you?

1121
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:26,975
Well...

1122
01:05:27,016 --> 01:05:29,006
How much do you want, Biff?

1123
01:05:30,077 --> 01:05:32,092
Whoa!

1124
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:38,834
Alright, punk.

1125
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,559
- Now, I'm gonna--
- Whoa, whoa, Biff.

1126
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,247
What's that?

1127
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:49,646
Calvin Klein.

1128
01:05:49,716 --> 01:05:51,849
Oh, my God!
He's a dream.

1129
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,060
Whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid! Stop, stop!

1130
01:05:54,105 --> 01:05:55,629
- Stop, stop.
- Hey!

1131
01:05:55,654 --> 01:05:57,747
- Let me borrow it.
- Stop, stop, stop!

1132
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:00,146
- I'll get it back to you, alright?
- Come on, go, go!

1133
01:06:00,177 --> 01:06:01,817
You broke it.

1134
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,880
Come back here!

1135
01:06:05,223 --> 01:06:07,825
Wow, look at him go!

1136
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:10,466
Damn it!

1137
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,242
To the car, to the car!
Go, go!

1138
01:06:31,823 --> 01:06:33,425
What's that thing he's on?

1139
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,972
It's a board with wheels.

1140
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:36,573
He's an absolute dream.

1141
01:06:36,598 --> 01:06:37,847
Come on, come on, come on!

1142
01:06:37,881 --> 01:06:40,018
Look out for the car!

1143
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:14,663
I'm gonna ram him.

1144
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,116
Shit!

1145
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:50,242
Thanks a lot, kid.

1146
01:07:51,078 --> 01:07:53,461
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

1147
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:54,755
Where does he come from?

1148
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:56,961
Yeah, where does he live?

1149
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:58,961
I don't know.

1150
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,625
But, I'm gonna find out.

1151
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:08,092
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1152
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:09,716
<i>They found me.</i>

1153
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,584
<i>I don't know how,
but they found me.</i>

1154
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:13,521
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

1155
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:19,584
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1156
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,319
<i>They found me.</i>

1157
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,209
<i>I don't know how,
but they found me.</i>

1158
01:08:23,255 --> 01:08:25,366
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

1159
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:27,131
Doc?

1160
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:29,053
Oh, hi, Marty.

1161
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:31,147
I didn't hear you come in.

1162
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:33,342
Fascinating device, this...

1163
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:34,935
video unit.

1164
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,725
Listen, Doc.

1165
01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:39,333
You know, there's something
I haven't told you about the night

1166
01:08:39,358 --> 01:08:40,677
- we made that tape.
- Please, Marty, don't tell me.

1167
01:08:40,703 --> 01:08:42,175
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

1168
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,528
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

1169
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,911
If I know too much
about my own future,

1170
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:46,350
I can endanger my own existence.

1171
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,989
Just as you have endangered yours.

1172
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:51,614
You, you're right.

1173
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:55,419
Now, let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1174
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,435
Please, excuse the crudity of this model.

1175
01:08:57,477 --> 01:08:59,778
I didn't have time to build it
to scale or to paint it.

1176
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:02,083
- It's good.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1177
01:09:03,003 --> 01:09:04,169
Okay, now.

1178
01:09:04,216 --> 01:09:07,296
We run some industrial strength
electrical cable from the top...

1179
01:09:07,328 --> 01:09:09,156
of the clock tower, down...

1180
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:12,202
suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts.

1181
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:14,031
Meanwhile, we've outfitted...

1182
01:09:14,078 --> 01:09:16,492
the time vehicle with
this big pole and hook,

1183
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:20,179
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

1184
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:22,632
At the calculated moment,

1185
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:24,054
you start off,

1186
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,116
from down the street,

1187
01:09:25,147 --> 01:09:29,343
driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1188
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,398
According to the flyer,
at precisely 10:04 p.m,

1189
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:35,101
this Saturday night,
lightning will strike the clock tower,

1190
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,828
electrifying the cable,

1191
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:39,210
just as the connecting hook makes contact,

1192
01:09:39,256 --> 01:09:43,148
thereby, sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor,

1193
01:09:43,202 --> 01:09:45,390
and sending you back to 1985.

1194
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:47,484
Alright, now.
Watch this.

1195
01:09:47,514 --> 01:09:49,952
You wind up the car and release it.

1196
01:09:51,202 --> 01:09:53,304
I'll simulate the lightning.

1197
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:03,328
Ready.

1198
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:14,140
Set.

1199
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:20,174
Release.

1200
01:10:23,837 --> 01:10:25,376
Whoa!

1201
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:40,630
You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence, Doc.

1202
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:42,263
Don't worry.
I'll take care of the lightning.

1203
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:44,544
You take care of your pop.

1204
01:10:45,927 --> 01:10:47,036
By the way,

1205
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:48,958
what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

1206
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:50,396
I think so.

1207
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,083
What did she say?

1208
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,948
It's your mom!

1209
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:02,339
She's tracked you down.
Quick.

1210
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,495
Let's cover the time machine.

1211
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:18,497
Hi,

1212
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,154
Cal--
Marty.

1213
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:21,692
Mom.
Lorraine.

1214
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:23,068
Uh...

1215
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:25,872
How did you know I was here?

1216
01:11:25,996 --> 01:11:28,028
I followed you.

1217
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,895
Oh, uh, this is my doc.

1218
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:32,216
My uncle.

1219
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:34,903
Doc Brown.

1220
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:36,849
- Hi.
- Hi.

1221
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:40,911
Marty, listen.

1222
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,982
This may seem a little forward,

1223
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:45,747
but I was kind of wondering if you...

1224
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:48,747
if, if you'd ask me to the...

1225
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:52,388
Enchantment Under the Sea dance
on Saturday.

1226
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,366
Uh, you mean...

1227
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:57,640
you mean nobody's asked you?

1228
01:11:57,788 --> 01:11:59,499
No.

1229
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:01,710
Not yet.

1230
01:12:02,538 --> 01:12:04,483
What about, what about George?

1231
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:06,702
George McFly?

1232
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:08,608
Oh.

1233
01:12:08,653 --> 01:12:11,155
He's kind of cute and all.

1234
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,999
But, not--

1235
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,663
Well,

1236
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:18,318
I think a man should be strong.

1237
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:22,170
So, he can stand up for himself,

1238
01:12:22,724 --> 01:12:25,310
and protect the woman he loves.

1239
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:31,201
Don't you?

1240
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:33,889
Yeah.

1241
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,490
I still don't understand.

1242
01:12:36,537 --> 01:12:39,360
How am I supposed to go
to the dance with her,

1243
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:41,506
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1244
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:44,740
Well, because George,
she wants to go with you.

1245
01:12:44,896 --> 01:12:46,873
She just doesn't know it yet.

1246
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:50,239
That's why we got to show her that you,
George McFly, are a fighter.

1247
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:52,151
You're somebody who's gonna
stand up for yourself,

1248
01:12:52,176 --> 01:12:53,675
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1249
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,794
Yeah, but, I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1250
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,552
Look, you're not gonna
be picking a fight, Dad.

1251
01:12:59,716 --> 01:13:01,817
Dad, dad, daddy-o.

1252
01:13:01,966 --> 01:13:04,302
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1253
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,745
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

1254
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:07,567
8:55, where are you gonna be?

1255
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:09,083
I'm gonna be at the dance.

1256
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:10,386
Right, and where am I gonna be?

1257
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:12,450
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1258
01:13:12,481 --> 01:13:13,958
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00,

1259
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,528
she's gonna get very angry with me.

1260
01:13:15,554 --> 01:13:17,833
Why is she gonna
get angry with you?

1261
01:13:17,879 --> 01:13:20,435
Well, because George,
nice girls get angry...

1262
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:23,356
when guys take advantage of them.

1263
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:24,786
Oh.

1264
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:26,919
You mean you're gonna
go touch her on her--

1265
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,817
No, no, George.

1266
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:30,114
Look.

1267
01:13:30,153 --> 01:13:32,349
It's just an act, right?

1268
01:13:32,403 --> 01:13:34,411
Okay. So, 9 o'clock,

1269
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:36,231
you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1270
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,911
You see us, uh,
struggling in the car.

1271
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,192
You walk up,

1272
01:13:41,224 --> 01:13:43,903
you open the door and you say...

1273
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,083
Your line, George.

1274
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:49,439
Oh, uh...

1275
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:53,548
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1276
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:56,680
You really think I ought to swear?

1277
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:59,016
Yes, definitely.
God damn it, George, swear.

1278
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:01,141
Okay. So now,
you come up.

1279
01:14:01,173 --> 01:14:02,429
You punch me in the stomach.

1280
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:04,141
I'm out for the count, right?

1281
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:07,313
And you and Lorraine live
happily ever after.

1282
01:14:07,345 --> 01:14:09,772
Well, you make it sound so easy.

1283
01:14:09,797 --> 01:14:12,368
I just,
I wish I wasn't so scared.

1284
01:14:12,393 --> 01:14:16,196
George, there's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is a little self-confidence.

1285
01:14:16,282 --> 01:14:18,946
You know,
if you put your mind to it,

1286
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:21,432
you can accomplish anything.

1287
01:14:22,886 --> 01:14:25,464
<i>Hill Valley area weather
this Saturday night.</i>

1288
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:28,636
<i>Mostly clear,
with some scattered clouds.</i>

1289
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,378
<i>Lows tonight in the upper 40s.</i>

1290
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:32,565
Are you sure about this storm?

1291
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,425
Since when can weathermen
predict the weather?

1292
01:14:35,473 --> 01:14:37,315
Let alone the future.

1293
01:14:37,612 --> 01:14:40,308
You know, Marty, I'm gonna
be very sad to see you go.

1294
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:41,855
You've really made
a difference in my life.

1295
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,956
You've given me
something to shoot for.

1296
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:45,356
Just knowing...

1297
01:14:45,396 --> 01:14:48,177
that I'm gonna be around to see 1985,

1298
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:50,309
that I'm gonna succeed in this,

1299
01:14:50,374 --> 01:14:53,512
that I'm gonna have a chance
to travel through time,

1300
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:02,086
It's gonna be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

1301
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:04,743
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

1302
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:07,571
I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.

1303
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,001
I'm really going to miss you.

1304
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:16,907
Doc, about the future...

1305
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:18,118
No!

1306
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:19,368
Marty!

1307
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:20,641
We've already agreed...

1308
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:23,462
that having information about
the future can be extremely dangerous.

1309
01:15:23,487 --> 01:15:25,077
Even if your intentions are good,

1310
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:27,704
it can backfire drastically.

1311
01:15:28,313 --> 01:15:29,610
Whatever you've got to tell me,

1312
01:15:29,642 --> 01:15:32,610
I'll find out through
the natural course of time.

1313
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:35,516
Dear Dr. Brown.

1314
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:39,008
On the night that I go back in time,

1315
01:15:39,336 --> 01:15:41,001
you will be...

1316
01:15:41,665 --> 01:15:44,571
shot by terrorists.

1317
01:15:45,156 --> 01:15:47,626
Please, take whatever
precautions necessary...

1318
01:15:47,657 --> 01:15:50,149
to prevent this terrible disaster.

1319
01:15:51,524 --> 01:15:53,227
Your friend,

1320
01:15:54,307 --> 01:15:55,985
Marty.

1321
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,705
Evening, Dr. Brown.

1322
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:07,990
What's with the wire?

1323
01:16:08,015 --> 01:16:09,416
Oh, just...

1324
01:16:09,502 --> 01:16:11,768
a little weather experiment.

1325
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:13,768
What you got under here?

1326
01:16:13,793 --> 01:16:14,861
No, no, don't touch that!

1327
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:17,478
Some new specialized
weather sensing equipment.

1328
01:16:17,564 --> 01:16:19,947
Yeah, well,
you got a permit for that?

1329
01:16:20,433 --> 01:16:22,169
Of course, I do.

1330
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:31,973
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

1331
01:17:23,956 --> 01:17:26,112
Do you mind if we...

1332
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:27,667
park...

1333
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:29,425
for a while?

1334
01:17:29,674 --> 01:17:31,988
That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.

1335
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:33,066
Huh?

1336
01:17:33,091 --> 01:17:35,788
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

1337
01:17:35,838 --> 01:17:38,281
It's not like I've never parked before.

1338
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:40,007
What?

1339
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:43,273
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1340
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,812
No.

1341
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:46,812
No.

1342
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:54,069
Lorraine, Lorraine,
what are you doing?

1343
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:56,670
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

1344
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:58,256
Yeah, well,

1345
01:17:58,381 --> 01:17:59,709
you shouldn't drink.

1346
01:17:59,757 --> 01:18:02,225
- Why not?
- Because you...

1347
01:18:02,451 --> 01:18:04,272
you might regret it,

1348
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:06,014
later in life.

1349
01:18:06,045 --> 01:18:08,217
Marty, don't be such a square.

1350
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:11,061
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

1351
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:17,968
Jeez, you smoke, too?

1352
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:21,812
Marty, you're beginning
to sound just like my mother.

1353
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:35,652
We're gonna take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while.

1354
01:18:35,681 --> 01:18:38,972
So, uh, don't nobody go nowhere.

1355
01:18:54,866 --> 01:18:56,309
Marty?

1356
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:58,942
Why are you so nervous?

1357
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,056
Lorraine.

1358
01:19:01,638 --> 01:19:03,423
Have you ever...

1359
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:04,735
uh...

1360
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:07,965
been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way,

1361
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,558
but when you got there,

1362
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,660
you didn't know if
you could go through with it?

1363
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:14,550
Oh, you mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1364
01:19:14,605 --> 01:19:16,925
Oh, uh, sort of.

1365
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,371
Oh, I, I think, I know
exactly what you mean.

1366
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:22,441
You, you, you do?

1367
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:25,208
You know what I do
in those situations?

1368
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:26,646
What?

1369
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,349
I don't worry.

1370
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,537
This is all wrong.

1371
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:50,419
I don't, I don't know what it is.

1372
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,701
But when I kiss you,

1373
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:55,497
it's like I'm kissing...

1374
01:19:56,302 --> 01:19:57,724
my brother.

1375
01:19:58,047 --> 01:20:00,591
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

1376
01:20:00,744 --> 01:20:02,412
Believe me.

1377
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:05,623
It makes perfect sense.

1378
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,147
Biff's coming.

1379
01:20:12,118 --> 01:20:16,451
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car you son of a bitch.

1380
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,498
And I'm gonna
take it out of your ass.

1381
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:20,068
Hold him.

1382
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:23,310
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.

1383
01:20:23,913 --> 01:20:26,865
Well, look at what we have here.

1384
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:30,241
No, no!

1385
01:20:30,266 --> 01:20:31,922
You're sitting right here with me.

1386
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:33,879
- Come on, Lorraine.
- Let me go.

1387
01:20:33,904 --> 01:20:35,458
Leave her alone, you bastard!

1388
01:20:35,483 --> 01:20:37,372
Guys, take him in back, alright?
I'll be right there.

1389
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,479
Just admit that you want it.

1390
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:40,604
Come on.

1391
01:20:40,647 --> 01:20:42,565
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.

1392
01:20:42,597 --> 01:20:44,385
- Oh!
- Oh.

1393
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,307
No! Stop!

1394
01:20:47,783 --> 01:20:49,276
Ouch!

1395
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:50,578
Hey, let's put him in there.

1396
01:20:50,603 --> 01:20:52,057
Yeah.

1397
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:55,529
That's for messing up my hair.

1398
01:20:55,974 --> 01:20:58,005
What the hell
are you doing to my car?

1399
01:20:58,059 --> 01:21:01,497
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1400
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:06,256
Who you calling spook, peckerwood?

1401
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:08,803
Hey, hey, listen guys.

1402
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,201
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

1403
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:13,865
- Get home to your mama, boy.
- Biff!

1404
01:21:14,123 --> 01:21:16,060
Hurry, Biff!

1405
01:21:16,259 --> 01:21:18,191
Let me out of here!

1406
01:21:18,402 --> 01:21:19,824
Yo!

1407
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:21,386
Reginald, where are your keys?

1408
01:21:21,436 --> 01:21:23,582
The keys are in the trunk.

1409
01:21:24,076 --> 01:21:25,121
Say that again?

1410
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:28,011
I said, the keys are in here.

1411
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:42,325
Come on!

1412
01:21:44,161 --> 01:21:47,731
Hey, you!
Get your damn hands off--

1413
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,982
Uh, oh.

1414
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:53,263
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1415
01:21:54,153 --> 01:21:56,347
George, help me!
Please!

1416
01:21:56,372 --> 01:21:59,880
Just turn around, McFly,
and walk away.

1417
01:22:00,036 --> 01:22:01,167
Please, George.

1418
01:22:01,192 --> 01:22:02,488
Are you deaf, McFly?

1419
01:22:02,513 --> 01:22:05,333
Close the door and beat it.

1420
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:08,839
No, Biff.

1421
01:22:09,183 --> 01:22:11,316
You leave her alone.

1422
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,800
Alright, McFly.

1423
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:18,292
You're asking for it,

1424
01:22:18,563 --> 01:22:20,652
and now you're going to get it.

1425
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:23,573
Biff, stop it!

1426
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:26,198
Biff, you'll break his arm.

1427
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:29,472
Biff, no!

1428
01:22:29,764 --> 01:22:31,909
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1429
01:22:32,505 --> 01:22:33,536
Ouch!

1430
01:22:33,561 --> 01:22:35,856
Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!

1431
01:22:35,926 --> 01:22:37,309
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

1432
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,457
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1433
01:22:40,563 --> 01:22:42,863
You're going to break his arm!

1434
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,145
Biff!

1435
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:46,418
Biff, leave him alone!

1436
01:22:46,452 --> 01:22:48,379
Let him go!
Let him go!

1437
01:23:21,947 --> 01:23:24,058
Are you okay?

1438
01:23:43,525 --> 01:23:45,746
Who is that guy?

1439
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,996
That's George McFly.

1440
01:23:51,014 --> 01:23:53,300
That's George McFly?

1441
01:23:53,388 --> 01:23:55,441
Excuse me.

1442
01:24:05,617 --> 01:24:07,362
The storm.

1443
01:24:09,393 --> 01:24:11,899
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1444
01:24:11,924 --> 01:24:13,447
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.

1445
01:24:13,472 --> 01:24:15,904
He can't play with his hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

1446
01:24:15,929 --> 01:24:18,238
Yeah, well, look, Marvin.
Marvin, you got to play.

1447
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:20,574
See, that's where they kiss
for the first time on the dance floor.

1448
01:24:20,606 --> 01:24:22,442
And if there is no music,
they can't dance.

1449
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:23,746
If they can't dance,
they can't kiss.

1450
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,930
If they can't kiss,
they can't fall in love and I'm history.

1451
01:24:25,962 --> 01:24:27,547
Hey man, the dance is over.

1452
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:31,235
Unless that you know somebody else
that can play the guitar.

Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

1512
01:28:30,112 --> 01:28:33,026
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

1513
01:28:33,078 --> 01:28:35,495
Well, listen to this.

1514
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:47,528
I guess, I guess you guys
aren't ready for that yet.

1515
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:51,418
But, your kids are gonna love it.

1516
01:29:54,466 --> 01:29:55,786
Lorraine.

1517
01:29:55,838 --> 01:29:58,474
Marty, that was very interesting music.

1518
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,450
Au, yeah.

1519
01:30:00,551 --> 01:30:02,310
Oh, and I hope you don't mind,

1520
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,403
but George asked
if he could take me home.

1521
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,263
Great! Good!
Good, Lorraine.

1522
01:30:07,388 --> 01:30:09,427
I had a feeling about you two.

1523
01:30:09,478 --> 01:30:11,544
I have a feeling, too.

1524
01:30:11,677 --> 01:30:13,161
Listen, I got to go,

1525
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:16,294
but, uh, I wanted to
tell you that it's been...

1526
01:30:16,607 --> 01:30:18,458
educational.

1527
01:30:18,896 --> 01:30:21,513
Marty, will we ever see you again?

1528
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:23,833
I guarantee it.

1529
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,317
Well, Marty.

1530
01:30:25,364 --> 01:30:28,333
I want to thank you
for all your good advice. So...

1531
01:30:28,405 --> 01:30:30,177
I'll never forget it.

1532
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,489
Right, George.

1533
01:30:33,407 --> 01:30:35,036
Well, uh...

1534
01:30:35,665 --> 01:30:37,919
good luck you guys.

1535
01:30:38,373 --> 01:30:39,959
Oh.

1536
01:30:40,874 --> 01:30:42,646
One other thing.

1537
01:30:42,802 --> 01:30:44,950
If you guys ever have kids,

1538
01:30:45,013 --> 01:30:47,341
and one of them,
when he's eight years old,

1539
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:51,294
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

1540
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,771
go easy on him.

1541
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:55,802
Okay.

1542
01:31:00,514 --> 01:31:01,872
Marty?

1543
01:31:02,113 --> 01:31:04,294
Such a nice name.

1544
01:31:09,335 --> 01:31:11,728
Damn!
Where is that kid?

1545
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:15,939
Damn!

1546
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,033
Damn! Damn!

1547
01:31:27,606 --> 01:31:28,708
You're late!

1548
01:31:28,755 --> 01:31:30,544
You have no concept of time?

1549
01:31:30,575 --> 01:31:31,841
Hey, come on.

1550
01:31:31,896 --> 01:31:33,052
I had to change.

1551
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,880
Do you think I'm going back
in that, that zoot suit?

1552
01:31:35,935 --> 01:31:38,208
Yeah, the old man
really came through.

1553
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,060
- It worked.
- What?

1554
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:40,802
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1555
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:42,105
I didn't know he had it in him.

1556
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:45,169
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1557
01:31:46,714 --> 01:31:47,856
Ever?

1558
01:31:47,931 --> 01:31:50,270
No. Why?
What's the matter?

1559
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,122
Alright!

1560
01:31:52,304 --> 01:31:55,052
Let's set your destination time.

1561
01:31:59,184 --> 01:32:01,784
This is the exact time you left.

1562
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:06,034
Let's send you back
at exactly the same time.

1563
01:32:08,128 --> 01:32:10,652
It'll be like you never left.

1564
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:13,152
Now,

1565
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:16,597
I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1566
01:32:16,636 --> 01:32:18,480
That's where you'll start from.

1567
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:20,862
I've calculated the precise distance,

1568
01:32:20,893 --> 01:32:23,573
taking into account
the acceleration speed,

1569
01:32:23,605 --> 01:32:26,369
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment...

1570
01:32:26,394 --> 01:32:28,120
the lightning strikes,

1571
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:29,433
which will be...

1572
01:32:29,496 --> 01:32:32,949
in exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1573
01:32:33,019 --> 01:32:35,644
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1574
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:37,277
Right.

1575
01:32:43,306 --> 01:32:44,588
Well,

1576
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,104
I guess that's everything.

1577
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,996
Thanks.

1578
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:53,972
Thank you.

1579
01:32:58,387 --> 01:33:01,113
See you in about 30 years.

1580
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:04,269
I hope so.

1581
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:07,238
Don't worry!

1582
01:33:07,519 --> 01:33:09,277
As long as you hit that wire...

1583
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,371
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour,

1584
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,941
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower...

1585
01:33:17,746 --> 01:33:19,324
everything will be fine.

1586
01:33:19,363 --> 01:33:20,965
Right.

1587
01:33:29,101 --> 01:33:31,109
What's the meaning of this?

1588
01:33:31,187 --> 01:33:32,898
You'll find out in 30 years.

1589
01:33:32,937 --> 01:33:35,211
It's about the future, isn't it?

1590
01:33:35,273 --> 01:33:37,765
- It's information about the future.
- Wait a minute.

1591
01:33:37,797 --> 01:33:39,828
I warned you about this, kid.

1592
01:33:39,859 --> 01:33:42,859
The consequences could be disastrous!

1593
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:45,289
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

1594
01:33:45,314 --> 01:33:47,328
Your life depends on it!

1595
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:48,524
No!

1596
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:52,289
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1597
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,562
In that case,
I'll tell you straight out.

1598
01:33:58,963 --> 01:34:00,956
Great Scott!

1599
01:34:08,246 --> 01:34:10,051
You get the cable.

1600
01:34:10,076 --> 01:34:12,004
- I'll throw the rope down to you.
- Right.

1601
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,910
I got it!

1602
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:49,003
Doc!

1603
01:34:56,263 --> 01:34:57,979
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

1604
01:34:58,004 --> 01:34:59,279
Alright!

1605
01:34:59,325 --> 01:35:01,029
Take it up!

1606
01:35:03,701 --> 01:35:05,248
Go!

1607
01:35:11,852 --> 01:35:13,159
Doc!

1608
01:35:13,191 --> 01:35:14,206
What?

1609
01:35:14,237 --> 01:35:17,769
I have to tell you about the future.

1610
01:35:17,808 --> 01:35:22,310
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

1611
01:35:22,364 --> 01:35:23,603
What?

1612
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:27,600
On the night,
I go back in time,

1613
01:35:27,647 --> 01:35:29,140
you get...

1614
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,522
Whoa, whoa.

1615
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:31,819
Oh.

1616
01:35:31,928 --> 01:35:33,616
Doc!

1617
01:35:38,948 --> 01:35:41,862
Oh!

1618
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:43,956
Go!

1619
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:45,674
No, Doc!

1620
01:35:45,713 --> 01:35:47,142
Look at the time!

1621
01:35:47,172 --> 01:35:49,212
You've got less than four minutes.

1622
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:51,174
Please, hurry!

1623
01:36:02,551 --> 01:36:03,991
Yeah!

1624
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:05,496
Mm!

1625
01:36:57,034 --> 01:36:58,041
Damn it, Doc!

1626
01:36:58,081 --> 01:37:00,409
Why did you have
to tear up that letter?

1627
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:02,557
If I only had more time.

1628
01:37:05,371 --> 01:37:06,701
Wait a minute.

1629
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:08,859
I got all the time I want.
I got a time machine.

1630
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:11,413
I can just go back early
and warn him.

1631
01:37:11,475 --> 01:37:12,476
Okay.

1632
01:37:12,514 --> 01:37:14,515
Ten minutes ought to do it.

1633
01:37:15,648 --> 01:37:16,718
Okay.

1634
01:37:16,757 --> 01:37:18,210
Time circuit's on.

1635
01:37:18,269 --> 01:37:20,038
Flux capacitor,

1636
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,336
fluxing.

1637
01:37:21,405 --> 01:37:22,788
Engine running.

1638
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:24,632
Alright.

1639
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:27,452
No.

1640
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:29,538
No, no, no, no, no.

1641
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:30,921
Come on.
Not this time.

1642
01:37:30,976 --> 01:37:32,913
Come on, come on.

1643
01:38:39,892 --> 01:38:41,650
Oh.

1644
01:38:42,225 --> 01:38:43,727
Come on.

1645
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:47,216
Here we go, here we go.

1646
01:38:47,248 --> 01:38:49,383
This time, come on.

1647
01:38:50,226 --> 01:38:53,195
Please. Please!
Come on!

1648
01:39:36,088 --> 01:39:38,345
Oh!

1649
01:40:31,336 --> 01:40:32,821
Doc.

1650
01:42:08,716 --> 01:42:11,544
Crazy drunk driver.

1651
01:42:21,305 --> 01:42:22,992
Woo!

1652
01:42:25,364 --> 01:42:26,468
Alright.

1653
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:28,961
Fred.

1654
01:42:29,703 --> 01:42:31,106
You look great.

1655
01:42:31,148 --> 01:42:32,859
Everything looks great.

1656
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:33,913
Oh, no.

1657
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:35,109
1:24.

1658
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,375
I still got time.

1659
01:42:36,421 --> 01:42:38,593
I'm coming, Doc!

1660
01:42:41,382 --> 01:42:42,515
No!

1661
01:42:42,609 --> 01:42:43,929
No, not again!

1662
01:42:43,964 --> 01:42:45,232
Come on.

1663
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:53,498
Hey!

1664
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,700
The Libyans.

1665
01:43:23,933 --> 01:43:26,363
No!

1666
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:28,074
You bastard!

1667
01:43:41,275 --> 01:43:42,929
Go!

1668
01:44:16,823 --> 01:44:18,274
Doc!

1669
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:19,837
Doc!

1670
01:44:24,444 --> 01:44:25,758
No.

1671
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:27,469
No.

1672
01:44:41,511 --> 01:44:43,401
You're alive.

1673
01:44:52,174 --> 01:44:54,143
Bulletproof vest?

1674
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:57,135
How did you know?

1675
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:00,870
I, I never got a chance to tell you.

1676
01:45:13,513 --> 01:45:15,353
What about all that talk?

1677
01:45:15,436 --> 01:45:17,771
About screwing up future events?

1678
01:45:17,803 --> 01:45:20,100
The space-time continuum?

1679
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,129
Well, I figured...

1680
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:24,021
what the hell?

1681
01:45:33,366 --> 01:45:35,327
So, how far ahead are you going?

1682
01:45:35,401 --> 01:45:37,202
About 30 years.

1683
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:38,459
It's a nice round number.

1684
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:40,717
Look me up when
you get there, alright?

1685
01:45:40,771 --> 01:45:43,059
I guess, I'll be about 47?

1686
01:45:43,116 --> 01:45:44,475
I will.

1687
01:45:44,748 --> 01:45:46,381
Take care.

1688
01:45:46,919 --> 01:45:48,155
You too.

1689
01:45:48,204 --> 01:45:49,350
Right.

1690
01:45:49,397 --> 01:45:50,624
Bye-bye, Einie.

1691
01:45:50,663 --> 01:45:54,327
Oh, and watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1692
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:56,225
You bet.

1693
01:46:34,192 --> 01:46:36,239

1694

01:47:00,926 --> 01:47:02,879
What a nightmare!

1700
01:47:13,952 --> 01:47:15,138
If Paul calls me,

1701
01:47:15,163 --> 01:47:17,061
tell him I'm working
at the boutique late tonight.

1702
01:47:17,087 --> 01:47:19,264
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service.

1703
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:21,435
Second of all, somebody
named Greg or Craig...

1704
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:22,827
called you just a little while ago.

1705
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,421
Well, which one was it,
Greg or Craig?

1706
01:47:24,446 --> 01:47:27,038
I don't know. I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

1707
01:47:27,063 --> 01:47:28,639
- Thanks.
- Hey.

1708
01:47:29,295 --> 01:47:31,335
What the hell is this?

1709
01:47:31,757 --> 01:47:33,241
Breakfast.

1710
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:35,796
What? You sleep in your clothes
again last night?

1711
01:47:35,897 --> 01:47:37,725
Yeah. I...

1712
01:47:38,233 --> 01:47:40,757
Yeah. What are,
what are you wearing, Dave?

1713
01:47:41,045 --> 01:47:42,413
Marty?

1714
01:47:42,662 --> 01:47:45,124
I always wear a suit to the office.

1715
01:47:45,608 --> 01:47:46,655
You alright?

1716
01:47:46,698 --> 01:47:47,882
Yeah.

1717
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:49,486
I think we need a rematch.

1718
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:50,658
- George.
- A, a rematch?

1719
01:47:50,683 --> 01:47:52,603
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1720
01:47:52,628 --> 01:47:54,230
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1721
01:47:56,576 --> 01:47:58,297
Mom! Dad!

1722
01:47:58,326 --> 01:48:00,365
- What? Did you hit your head?
- Marty, are you alright?

1723
01:48:00,404 --> 01:48:02,484
You guys, you guys look great.

1724
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:04,521
Mom, you, you look so thin.

1725
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:06,258
Thank you, Marty.

1726
01:48:06,292 --> 01:48:08,024
George!

1727
01:48:08,507 --> 01:48:10,391
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1728
01:48:11,501 --> 01:48:13,462
Good morning, Dave.
Good morning, Mom.

1729
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,568
- Linda.
- Good morning, Mom.

1730
01:48:14,593 --> 01:48:16,751
Oh Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1731
01:48:16,783 --> 01:48:21,072
Oh, I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1732
01:48:21,134 --> 01:48:23,432
Isn't tonight the night
of the big date?

1733
01:48:23,457 --> 01:48:25,228
What? What, Ma?

1734
01:48:25,275 --> 01:48:26,901
Aren't you going up
to the lake tonight?

1735
01:48:26,926 --> 01:48:29,251
You've been planning it
for two weeks.

1736
01:48:29,329 --> 01:48:32,391
Um, Mom, we talked about this.
We're not gonna go to the lake.

1737
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:34,197
- The car's wrecked.
- Wrecked?

1738
01:48:34,222 --> 01:48:35,275
- Wrecked?
- What happened?

1739
01:48:35,306 --> 01:48:36,720
When did this happen?

1740
01:48:36,745 --> 01:48:37,902
- And why wasn't I told?
- Quiet down.

1741
01:48:37,927 --> 01:48:38,956
I'm sure the car is fine.

1742
01:48:38,981 --> 01:48:41,394
Why am I always the last one
to know about these things?

1743
01:48:41,425 --> 01:48:44,356
See? There's Biff out there
waxing it right now.

1744
01:48:44,381 --> 01:48:45,740
Uh, now Biff,

1745
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:49,310
I want to make sure that we get
two coats of wax this time, not just one.

1746
01:48:49,348 --> 01:48:50,990
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1747
01:48:51,015 --> 01:48:54,001
Now Biff, don't con me.

1748
01:48:54,662 --> 01:48:57,162
Uh, I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1749
01:48:57,231 --> 01:49:00,498
I, I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1750
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:03,123
Yeah, Biff.
What a character!

1751
01:49:03,209 --> 01:49:05,631
Always trying to get away
with something.

1752
01:49:05,662 --> 01:49:08,379
Have to stay on top of Biff
ever since high school.

1753
01:49:08,654 --> 01:49:11,006
Although, if it wasn't for him...

1754
01:49:11,036 --> 01:49:12,795
We never would have fallen in love.

1755
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,381
That's right.

1756
01:49:14,458 --> 01:49:15,863
Mr. McFly!

1757
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,459
Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1758
01:49:17,487 --> 01:49:20,418
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your new book.

1759
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:23,676
Oh, honey.

1760
01:49:23,726 --> 01:49:26,192
- Oh.
- Your first novel.

1761
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:28,901
Like I've always told you:
Put your mind to it,

1762
01:49:28,926 --> 01:49:30,706
you can accomplish anything.

1763
01:49:30,746 --> 01:49:31,981
Oh, Marty.

1764
01:49:32,012 --> 01:49:33,348
Marty here's your keys.

1765
01:49:33,379 --> 01:49:35,614
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

1766
01:49:35,683 --> 01:49:37,403
Keys?

1767
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:54,913
How about a ride, mister?

1768
01:49:55,006 --> 01:49:56,444
Jennifer.

1769
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,538
Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes!

1770
01:49:59,663 --> 01:50:01,444
Let me look at you.

1771
01:50:01,772 --> 01:50:04,585
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1772
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:06,257
I haven't.

1773
01:50:06,858 --> 01:50:08,350
You okay?

1774
01:50:08,725 --> 01:50:10,710
Is everything alright?

1775
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:14,885
Oh, yeah.

1776
01:50:16,689 --> 01:50:18,682
Everything is great.

1777
01:50:32,713 --> 01:50:34,260
Marty!

1778
01:50:35,057 --> 01:50:37,393
You've got to come back with me!

1779
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:39,018
Where?

1780
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,979
Back to the future.

1781
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:47,493
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

1782
01:50:47,969 --> 01:50:49,719
I need fuel.

1783
01:50:52,376 --> 01:50:54,797
Go ahead. Quick.
Get in the car.

1784
01:50:54,915 --> 01:50:57,243
No, no, no, Doc.
I just got here, okay?

1785
01:50:57,268 --> 01:50:59,316
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

1786
01:50:59,344 --> 01:51:01,141
Well, bring her along.

1787
01:51:01,204 --> 01:51:02,579
This concerns her, too.

1788
01:51:02,611 --> 01:51:04,329
Wait a minute, Doc.
What are you talking about?

1789
01:51:04,371 --> 01:51:06,477
What happens to us in the future?

1790
01:51:06,508 --> 01:51:08,351
We become assholes or something?

1791
01:51:08,376 --> 01:51:09,491
No, no, no, no, Marty.

1792
01:51:09,516 --> 01:51:11,313
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.

1793
01:51:11,338 --> 01:51:12,795
It's your kids, Marty.

1794
01:51:12,844 --> 01:51:15,594
Something has got
to be done about your kids.

1795
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:24,545
Hey, Doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1796
01:51:24,584 --> 01:51:25,716
Roads?

1797
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:29,420
Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
