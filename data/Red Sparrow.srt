1
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,686
This is an automated test

2
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,790
of your digital phone line.

3
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,710
Sorry for the interruption.

4
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,442
Charlie. Victor. Whiskey.

5
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:36,506
- Zero.
- Edward.

6
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,611
- X.
- Lincoln.

7
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:38,738
- Ida.
- Alpha.

8
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,282
- Frank.
- Alpha.

9
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,716
You're awake, Mama.

10
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,848
Morning, angel.

11
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:47,092
How did you sleep?

12
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,601
Not very well.

13
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,396
I'm sorry.
You ready?

14
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,484
How do you feel?

15
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:56,860
A little stiff.

16
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,238
Go slowly,
and I'll make some tea.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,573
Mmm-hmm.

18
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,828
Squeeze mine.

19
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,915
Good.

20
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,807
Hello.
You're late.

21
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,021
Are you in a rush?

22
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,981
Always,
I'm a busy woman!

23
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,991
Toi toi,
my darling.

24
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:20,737
I should be back at 10:00.
Okay.

25
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,323
Hello, Leni.
Hello, my beauty.

26
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,316
Tonight, you are
the pride of Russia.

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,112
May I present my niece,
Dominika Egorova?

28
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,077
And Dmitri Ustinov,
a valued friend to the arts.

29
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,000
If there is ever
anything I can do for you,

30
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,794
don't hesitate to ask.

31
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,085
May we have a photo?

32
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,258
Yes.

33
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,505
American!

34
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,053
American! Don't shoot!

35
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,558
American!

36
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,011
American!
Get on your knees!

37
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,231
Ow!

38
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,717
Did you hear anything?

39
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,802
As far as we know,
he got away clean.

40
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:20,913
They'll be in your
apartment by now.

41
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:21,937
Anything sensitive?

42
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,722
No, no.
Of course not.

43
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,460
Okay, you'll fly to D.C.
in the morning.

44
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,170
It'll be a stink,
but we'll get you out.

45
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,815
Doesn't look like anyone
was actually killed...

46
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,150
but Washington
has questions.

47
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:34,907
So I gotta ask,
what the fuck were you thinking?

48
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:36,738
I was protecting my asset.

49
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,496
How'd that work out?
He got away, didn't he?

50
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,747
Well, I guess you should
hear it from me.

51
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,871
Those guys in the park?

52
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:46,412
Word is they were vice cops,
looking for Chechen dealers...

53
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,581
or some family guy getting
a blow job in the bushes.

54
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,501
They weren't there for Marble.
They just got lucky.

55
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,240
Chances are they would
have questioned you,

56
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:55,629
and let you go.

57
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:01,101
But you can bet your ass
they're looking for him now.

58
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,647
They are expecting you,
Deputy Director.

59
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:12,825
Thank you.

60
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,658
Terrible news
about your niece.

61
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,741
I trust she's recovering.

62
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,910
She's in surgery now.

63
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:27,751
But the prognosis
for her leg is not good.

64
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,962
Sorry to hear that. Drink?

65
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,172
That depends.
What's the occasion?

66
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,882
I think
you'll want one.

67
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:39,722
There was an incident
last night, at Gorky Park.

68
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:44,474
Undercover narcotics agents
saw what they thought...

69
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,688
was a drug deal in process.

70
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:50,321
When they moved in
to question this man...

71
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,902
the other man
fired his weapon.

72
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,908
A clear attempt
at distraction.

73
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,161
Now we know
his name is Nate Nash.

74
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,826
Officially, a commercial
counselor, but he's CIA.

75
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,915
He left the country
this morning

76
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,462
on a diplomatic
passport.

77
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:08,964
However,
the man he was meeting...

78
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,251
doesn't panic, doesn't run.

79
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,262
He simply walks away.

80
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,387
My question is...

81
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,426
who is he?

82
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,640
Your Uncle Vanya has come
to visit the invalids.

83
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,150
You look well.

84
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,693
Doctor said you wouldn't
be walking for months.

85
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,233
Doctors don't know
everything.

86
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,943
No, they don't.

87
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,820
I'll make some tea.

88
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,825
Let me help.

89
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,745
I'm glad my brother
isn't here to see

90
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,546
what that clumsy fool
did to you.

91
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,666
It would have
broken his heart.

92
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:09,204
It was an accident.

93
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,257
Are you smoking?

94
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,550
I can smell it on you.

95
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,094
Why not?

96
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,182
I've heard they already
have a replacement

97
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,892
for you at the company.

98
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,151
This girl named Sonya.

99
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,278
Apparently
she's good.

100
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,568
Not as good as you,
but with time she can learn.

101
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:34,661
Have you read
the reviews?

102
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,117
Competitive as you are.

103
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,032
Have you come
to commiserate, Uncle?

104
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,574
No, I've come to help.

105
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,248
Tell me, this apartment,

106
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:44,249
it belongs
to the Bolshoi, right?

107
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:46,652
How long do you think
they will let you stay here...

108
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:49,214
now that you are no longer
part of the company?

109
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:51,880
Three months, six months?
If they are generous.

110
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,095
And what about medical
coverage for your mother?

111
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:56,509
They pay that as well, right?
Yes.

112
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:58,018
Does she know?

113
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,645
She's not stupid.

114
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:00,767
Of course not.

115
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:02,599
And I know I haven't
been around as much

116
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,560
since my brother died.

117
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:07,688
But I'm here now.

118
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,904
And I want to help you.

119
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:13,948
So come see me
when you're ready. Please.

120
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,155
I have something
for you.

121
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,842
You know, Dominika...

122
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:30,508
there are no accidents.

123
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,547
We create our own fate.

124
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,185
Sonya?

125
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:49,903
Hey.

126
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:51,905
How are you?

127
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,444
What is it?

128
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,036
I'm scared.

129
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,542
I went to see her
at the hospital.

130
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,919
The way she looked at me,
she knows.

131
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:03,876
She doesn't know.

132
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,296
What we have done is a sin.

133
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,670
They've always favored her.

134
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:13,307
No one else ever got a chance.
Is that fair?

135
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,559
Isn't that a sin?

136
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,308
Good! I think
it's enough for tonight.

137
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,646
Get some rest.

138
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,654
In three minutes.

139
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,729
There's been an accident
at the Bolshoi Theatre.

140
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,890
Women's locker room.
Please hurry.

141
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,069
Leni?

142
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,489
Mama?

143
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:37,959
Mama?

144
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,956
What? What happened?

145
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,376
No one was here.

146
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,430
Where was Leni?

147
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,049
The Bolshoi said they
wouldn't pay her anymore.

148
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,519
I'm going to
take care of us.

149
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,768
I'm gonna take care
of us now.

150
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:10,532
Could have come
to my office.

151
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:11,706
It's cold outside.

152
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:12,955
Not yet.

153
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,287
You broke her jaw.

154
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,192
You always had a temper,
haven't you?

155
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:21,422
You said
you could help us.

156
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,087
If you help me.

157
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:25,293
So what do you
want me to do?

158
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,680
State security
is interested in

159
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,099
knowing more
about Dmitri Ustinov.

160
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,229
You met him at the Bolshoi.
Remember?

161
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,650
He likes you.

162
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:39,479
A broken bird
that he could help.

163
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:41,485
Something his ego
won't be able to resist.

164
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,415
So in a few weeks,
when your leg is better...

165
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,198
I want you
to get to know him.

166
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,109
And get close to him.
And win his trust.

167
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,116
How do you propose
I win his trust?

168
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,102
You've always known how
to put on a show, Dominika.

169
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:54,126
Find someone else.

170
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:57,082
Have you ever seen
a state-run hospice?

171
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:01,461
Rats in the hallways,
patients lying in their own waste?

172
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,501
If you do this,
Dominika...

173
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,966
I will make sure your mother
can keep her doctors.

174
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,347
And I can make sure you can
stay in your apartment.

175
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:11,727
But only if I can show you can
be of value to the state.

176
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:14,975
It's one night.
That's all I ask.

177
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,893
Do this for your mother,
Dominika.

178
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,364
He has dinner
at the Hotel Andarja

179
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,656
every Friday at 9:00.

180
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:27,864
A car will arrive
at your apartment

181
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,286
to bring you to the hotel.

182
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,447
Now, you carry
nothing with you.

183
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,333
We will arrange a room
and something for you to wear.

184
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:38,750
Make yourself presentable.

185
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,625
And wear your hair
the way you wore it

186
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,759
that night at the Bolshoi.

187
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,171
And let him see you.
Just sit at the bar.

188
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,052
Now, he sits
at the same table,

189
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,633
overlooking the restaurant.

190
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,247
You will stand out
from the sort of women

191
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,432
who tend to go there.

192
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:54,846
I'm certain
he will initiate contact.

193
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:56,936
And just do what he asks.

194
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,351
And when he drops his guard,

195
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:00,366
I want you to replace
his phone with a duplicate.

196
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,064
I will make sure you are safe.

197
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,087
Glass of champagne, please.
Certainly.

198
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,650
Dominika Egorova.

199
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,061
What a pleasure.
May I join you?

200
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,900
Actually,
I'm waiting for a friend.

201
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:44,065
Then let me keep you
company while you wait.

202
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:45,404
Please.

203
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,281
Terrible what happened
to you.

204
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,494
Just bad luck.

205
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:52,825
I don't think
you believe that.

206
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,877
My father
drank himself to death

207
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,580
by the age of 43
and left us with nothing.

208
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,417
Now, I could buy this place
and anyone in it.

209
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:02,926
Is that luck?

210
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,089
You think anyone
born in my situation

211
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,594
could have done the same?

212
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,976
There is
no such thing as luck.

213
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,137
Just like you being here.

214
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,936
There is no friend,
is there?

215
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:20,359
Tell me the real reason
you are here.

216
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,249
I came to see you.

217
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:35,203
And what is it
you want from me?

218
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:37,999
All I ever wanted
was to be a dancer.

219
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,882
Ever since I was
a small child...

220
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,513
when I would take the bus
to rehearsal after school...

221
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,640
and I would look out
of the windows

222
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,287
at the people
going about their lives...

223
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:52,930
going to work,
half-asleep...

224
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:55,316
and I would
tell myself...

225
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,693
"I'm not like them...

226
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:00,696
"and I never will be...

227
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,448
"because I'm special."

228
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:07,403
I want to be
special again.

229
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,640
It's a beautiful room.

230
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,226
I'm surprised
you can afford it.

231
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,314
Will you excuse me,
for just a moment?

232
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:41,940
Of course.

233
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:14,641
Can we be alone?

234
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:30,082
Take off your dress.

235
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:43,214
Take off your dress.

236
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,246
Come here.

237
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:16,799
May I?

238
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,432
A crack in the vase.

239
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,524
True value comes
in the smallest imperfection.

240
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,191
A defining detail...

241
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:43,278
that makes it worthy
of collection.

242
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,125
Slow down.

243
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:04,345
Okay. Slow down.

244
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,811
No, no! Slowly!

245
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:08,981
Slowly!

246
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:25,510
Hey! Hey, you!

247
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:37,455
How did it happen?

248
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,430
Ustinov dismissed
his security,

249
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:42,053
so I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

250
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,562
Why would he do that?

251
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:47,222
She asked him to.

252
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:52,694
She could be useful.

253
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:54,184
She's a witness.

254
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:55,568
Get rid of her.

255
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:57,740
I trust her discretion.

256
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:02,702
If I were you,
I would be very sure.

257
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,533
Who is she?

258
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,710
My niece.

259
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:10,292
The dancer?

260
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,874
Yes.

261
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:20,466
Shame.

262
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,283
You knew what would happen,

263
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:43,206
once I got him in that room,
didn't you?

264
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:44,491
You wouldn't have gone

265
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:45,980
if I had told you
what had to happen.

266
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:47,085
I would have had a choice.

267
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:48,620
You know what I do.

268
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,749
You came to me.
That was your choice.

269
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,131
You are my uncle.

270
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:57,054
I would never have
let him hurt you.

271
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,931
He was inside me.

272
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:04,220
I don't want to die.

273
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,014
You don't have to.

274
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:08,899
There's another life for you,
if you want it.

275
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,528
You have potential,
great potential.

276
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,447
Now, you did well
to get him alone.

277
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:16,699
What you said in that bar
was exactly right...

278
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,703
because you told him exactly
what he needed to hear.

279
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:22,114
There is a program
that can teach you

280
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,824
everything you need to know.

281
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,085
The training is very hard.

282
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:27,416
Only a few make it.

283
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,503
But you know how to survive.
That's why I chose you.

284
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:33,175
Unless if I'm wrong.

285
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:36,132
Perhaps you don't like
my line of work.

286
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,805
Perhaps you disapprove.

287
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,137
In that case...

288
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:43,224
your future
will be out of my hands.

289
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,603
I'm sorry.

290
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:01,038
Morning, Mama.

291
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:02,741
What is it?

292
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,080
I have to go away
for a while.

293
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,257
Leni will come stay.

294
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:16,262
It's something
your uncle has arranged.

295
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,595
I'll be able
to take care of us now.

296
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:21,010
You don't have to do this.

297
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:22,808
It's too late
for that now.

298
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,689
Oh, no.
What have you done?

299
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:27,020
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,315
Now,
I warned you about him.

301
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:33,615
The way he looked at you
as a child.

302
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,025
Mama.

303
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,490
I tried
to keep him away.

304
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:41,035
I tried to protect you.

305
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:43,746
You hold
something back, hmm?

306
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,412
Don't give him all of you.

307
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:49,957
That is how you survive.

308
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:51,709
Yes, Mama.

309
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:01,435
Welcome to
State School Four.

310
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,221
You will know me as Matron.

311
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,935
Inside, you will find
the name

312
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,642
you will use
during your training.

313
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,437
Under no circumstances will
you reveal your true name...

314
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:11,480
or any other
personal information,

315
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,691
to a cadet
or member of staff.

316
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:15,735
Is that understood?
Yes.

317
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:18,324
Good. I'll show you
to your room.

318
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:27,796
You're not like
our usual recruits.

319
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,708
Most of them
come from the military

320
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:31,793
with some
training already.

321
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,882
You'll have to work hard
to catch up.

322
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:36,172
I will do
what is asked of me.

323
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,465
I'm sure you will.

324
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,803
But someone like you does
not end up here by choice.

325
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:44,099
A prima ballerina
with a uncle in the SVR.

326
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,684
What is your crime?

327
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:50,479
Well, I suppose
it doesn't matter.

328
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,941
If you cannot be
of service to the state,

329
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,867
I am to put a bullet
through your head.

330
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,119
The Cold War did not end.

331
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:03,581
It shattered into
a thousand dangerous pieces.

332
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,837
The West has grown weak.

333
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:08,624
Drunk on shopping
and social media.

334
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:12,548
Torn apart by hatred
between the races.

335
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,886
And as a result,
the world is in chaos.

336
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,807
Only Russia is willing
to make the sacrifices

337
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,103
required for victory.

338
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,354
For there to be peace...

339
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:25,186
we must once again
place ourselves

340
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,733
at the head of nations.

341
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:29,688
From this day forward,
you will become Sparrows.

342
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:32,904
Weapons in a global
struggle for power.

343
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:36,449
You have been selected
because of your beauty.

344
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,247
Because of your strength.

345
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:43,126
And in some cases because
of your vulnerability.

346
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:49,960
Katya, Viktor,
come here, please.

347
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:59,728
Here, we deal in
psychological manipulation.

348
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,980
You'll be trained to determine
a target's weakness...

349
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,893
to exploit that weakness
through seduction...

350
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,987
and to extract information.

351
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,615
Take off your clothes.

352
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,077
Your body
belongs to the state.

353
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:22,210
Since your birth,
the state nourished it.

354
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,789
Now the state asks
something in return.

355
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:33,884
You must learn to sacrifice
for a higher purpose.

356
00:32:34,892 --> 00:32:37,259
To push yourself
beyond all limitation...

357
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,849
and forget
the sentimental morality

358
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,350
with which you were raised.

359
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,683
Or is it pride?

360
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,148
In my experience,

361
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:48,195
the proud
are the first to fall.

362
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,283
Viktor, put on your clothes.

363
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,417
They're ready for you.

364
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,550
It is the recommendation
of this panel...

365
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,806
that you be
suspended indefinitely

366
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,258
from foreign assignment.

367
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,803
You'll be staying here
in the States, Nate.

368
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,017
So who's gonna
handle Marble?

369
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:21,773
That's no longer
your concern.

370
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,399
Simon...

371
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,022
I've been with this guy
for three years.

372
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:32,326
He is not going to
deal with anybody...

373
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:34,988
that he doesn't know,
and doesn't trust.

374
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:40,080
Like I said.
That is no longer your concern.

375
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:00,685
Metka.

376
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:05,353
An invisible chemical compound
tailored to each subject.

377
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:08,860
Worn on the hands,
after intimate contact...

378
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:12,447
the subject will be traceable
for up to six weeks.

379
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,168
Every human being
is a puzzle of need.

380
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,419
You must learn
to intuit what is missing.

381
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:27,504
Become the missing piece...

382
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,420
and they will
give you anything.

383
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,974
This man is a diplomat
at the Dutch Embassy

384
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,143
with access to
NATO military planning.

385
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:37,929
Six years ago,
his marriage ended...

386
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,064
when the police were
called to his apartment

387
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,142
for a domestic
disturbance.

388
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:44,230
His wife accused him

389
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:46,608
of inappropriately
touching their daughter.

390
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,861
Several nights a week,
he hires girls.

391
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:52,152
Runaways. Addicts.

392
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:54,206
What does he want?

393
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,873
He wants
something rough.

394
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,034
He goes to runaways because
they cannot call the police.

395
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:00,873
No.
You disagree?

396
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:02,208
He wants a daughter...

397
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:06,171
someone to take care of,
and he'll pay for it.

398
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,045
Very good, Katya.

399
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,715
He never touches
the girls.

400
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,475
He buys them dinner.

401
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,727
Next...

402
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:20,016
This man represented
Chuvashia in Parliament.

403
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:22,817
He was a leading critic
of the president,

404
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:25,522
until he was arrested
for indecency.

405
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,613
What did he want?

406
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,656
He looks like a degenerate.

407
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,830
By a degenerate,
you mean a homosexual?

408
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,365
- Yes.
- Correct.

409
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:39,285
Though, we mustn't
be so judgmental.

410
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,752
We all have our passions.
His happen to be rather young.

411
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,336
Anya, come here
for a moment.

412
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:06,985
Here he is.

413
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:09,029
Give him what he wants.

414
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,493
What do you mean?

415
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:14,364
You called him
a degenerate?

416
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:17,501
Therefore, he doesn't want
what's between your legs.

417
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:19,082
So, be a boy.

418
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,456
On your knees.

419
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,092
Not the first time,
I'm sure.

420
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:33,511
Must have been some boy
in a field behind your house.

421
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,645
A girl in a rainy bus stop?

422
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,681
We'd like to think
it makes a difference.

423
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:38,939
But it doesn't.

424
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,521
It's just flesh.

425
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:45,358
I can't!

426
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:46,773
Yes, you can.

427
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,567
Tomorrow,
you'll try again.

428
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:51,745
And again
the day after that.

429
00:36:57,796 --> 00:37:00,629
You must inure yourself
to what you find repellant.

430
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:05,175
Find beauty
in the human delusion...

431
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:06,836
that the pleasures
of the flesh

432
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,138
will make us whole again.

433
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:13,184
Even when
the subject is repellant,

434
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:15,012
the body can be tricked.

435
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,569
A graze of the fingers
to the thigh...

436
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,287
brings blood to the groin.

437
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,494
Manipulation
of the nipple...

438
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,870
leads to arousal.

439
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,711
Audio cues trigger...

440
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,384
sexual desire.

441
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,892
But physical manipulation
is not enough.

442
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,267
You must learn
to love on command.

443
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,484
What is it to be loved?

444
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,483
To be seen.

445
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,114
To be recognized.

446
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,826
To feel no longer alone.

447
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,492
Wall will handle from

448
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:28,660
the top of the key,
right side.

449
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:29,685
Goes down low to Smith.

450
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,843
Double team coming,
swings it back out to Wall.

451
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:33,887
Fifteen-foot jump shot
from the left wing...

452
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,647
Too strong off the back iron.

453
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:39,276
Rebound, fought for and
controlled there by Sellers...

454
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,404
The big man, ninth year
out of Colorado State...

455
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,938
When did you
first notice the tail?

456
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:45,198
Week ago.

457
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:46,489
And what do you
make of that?

458
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:47,972
If the Russians
are still following me,

459
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,327
it means they're
looking for him.

460
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:51,267
It means that Marble's still
out there. He's still alive.

461
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,907
As far as we know.

462
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:54,751
You're not talking to him.

463
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,127
Marble's refused all
attempts at communication...

464
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:58,737
over the last
four and a half months.

465
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:00,623
He will come out for me.

466
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:04,418
I know you can't get me into Russia,
but somewhere close.

467
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,679
Somewhere in
Eastern Europe.

468
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,807
And SVR will be
on me right away.

469
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,436
Marble will get word.
He's gonna surface.

470
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:14,458
Otherwise, I guarantee you,
he's just gonna stay silent.

471
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:16,519
Simon, you gotta
send me back.

472
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:17,693
All right.

473
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,443
But you got one assignment.

474
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,442
You make contact,

475
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:24,194
and you convince him to
work with another officer.

476
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,318
That'd be me. We'll
be coming with you.

477
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:29,157
Would you have
a problem with that?

478
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:30,696
No. No problem.

479
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,542
These soldiers
have been deployed overseas

480
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:43,172
for almost a year.

481
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:47,965
Welcome them home.

482
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:10,573
Turn out the lights.
No rush.

483
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:11,912
What's your name?

484
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:13,834
Pyotr.

485
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:38,648
You have someone at home?

486
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:40,608
Someone you think about?

487
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,491
Close your eyes.

488
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:53,701
Think of her face.

489
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:56,871
Remember her smell,
her touch...

490
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,665
What can we say
about this?

491
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:02,044
Sweet, sentimental,
maintaining control.

492
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,839
But you chose
a boy, Katya.

493
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:06,222
And you chose a boy

494
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,550
so you would
not have to give yourself.

495
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:11,220
Won't always be that easy.

496
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:12,314
Next!

497
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:45,176
Three days ago,
Nash was reassigned to Budapest.

498
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,681
I believe it is an attempt

499
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:48,509
to re-establish
contact with the mole.

500
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,123
We have
friends in Budapest.

501
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:51,513
Have them pick him up,

502
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:54,441
and extract
the information directly.

503
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,477
That means we have to
explain to President...

504
00:41:56,654 --> 00:41:58,299
why every officer
we have in Western Europe

505
00:41:58,323 --> 00:41:59,813
is snatched
in retaliation.

506
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,481
Vanya's correct.

507
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,741
The president will
not condone anything

508
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:06,490
that antagonizes
the Americans unnecessarily.

509
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:10,457
Not yet.

510
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,410
What do you
propose, Ivan?

511
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:13,999
Nash is
a skilled officer.

512
00:42:14,173 --> 00:42:18,462
That night, in the park,
he made a mistake.

513
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,047
He reacted emotionally...

514
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:23,880
which tells me
he cares about the man.

515
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,769
I propose we give him
someone else to care about.

516
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:51,209
You're accused of
assaulting a fellow cadet.

517
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:52,995
He tried to rape me.

518
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:55,129
And your honor
is worth depriving Russia

519
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:56,627
of a promising cadet.

520
00:42:56,801 --> 00:43:01,262
It was never my intention
to deprive Russia of anything.

521
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:02,887
And yet here we are.

522
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,633
Matron, what is
your opinion?

523
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,301
It's only
been three months...

524
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:10,597
but I believe
Katya still has potential.

525
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:13,357
I would like a moment alone
with the accused.

526
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,116
You did well
with Ustinov in Moscow.

527
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:29,032
That is why you were
given this chance.

528
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,042
You were told
what would happen to you,

529
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,211
if you fail here?

530
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,748
Yes. So why not
let him have you?

531
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:36,461
I serve the state.

532
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:38,459
I serve our president.

533
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:44,344
I serve you, General.
But I owe him nothing.

534
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:47,310
What sort of man
would send his niece

535
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:48,853
to State School Four?

536
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,646
A patriot.

537
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:56,395
My wife and I saw you
dance once.

538
00:43:56,573 --> 00:43:58,314
That was a different life.

539
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:02,359
There are so many.
Don't you find?

540
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:07,665
You may go.

541
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:20,382
Sparrows must
harden themselves

542
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:22,135
against the weak
and sentimental...

543
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:25,017
and see these things
for what they are.

544
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:26,643
Selfishness.

545
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:32,349
Tell me, Katya...

546
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:33,851
what does he want?

547
00:44:34,988 --> 00:44:35,988
Come forward.

548
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,910
For the deception
to be complete,

549
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,833
you must
hold nothing back.

550
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,586
Nothing. Understand?

551
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:56,959
Give him what he wants.

552
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,641
Well?

553
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:10,102
Turn around.

554
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,893
I said, turn around!
No.

555
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,447
Don't look at her.

556
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,744
I want to watch you do it.

557
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:29,577
Look at me!

558
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,256
Look at me.

559
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:39,545
I said look at me!

560
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:57,773
Well?

561
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:06,741
What are you waiting for?

562
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:11,454
I'm ready.

563
00:46:11,632 --> 00:46:12,997
Are you going
to fuck me or not?

564
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,425
Nothing?

565
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,431
Shame.

566
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:30,354
Bitch.

567
00:46:34,072 --> 00:46:35,153
Power.

568
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,408
That's what he wants.

569
00:46:39,204 --> 00:46:40,239
Get dressed.

570
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:55,384
There is a car waiting
to take you to Moscow.

571
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:58,888
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

572
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:00,058
On the contrary.

573
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,392
You have done
nothing I asked.

574
00:47:03,812 --> 00:47:05,803
But my superiors
think otherwise.

575
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:12,019
I suppose we'll find out.

576
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,280
Goodbye...

577
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,991
Dominika.

578
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,290
Hello, Mama.

579
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:40,381
It's you.

580
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,050
I'm home.

581
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:44,186
My baby...

582
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:58,033
Hello?

583
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,373
Yes.

584
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,964
He'll never let you go.

585
00:48:12,677 --> 00:48:14,213
I'll find away.

586
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:30,227
Welcome home.
How are you?

587
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,111
Have a seat.

588
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:36,817
What can I get you?
I'm not hungry.

589
00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:38,201
Oh, come on.

590
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:40,404
You used to love this place
when you were little.

591
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:43,449
You were always so serious
with your big, grown-up eyes

592
00:48:43,543 --> 00:48:44,704
in your child's face.

593
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,789
What do you want,
Uncle?

594
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:50,049
There is a traitor highly
placed in the government.

595
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:53,210
Probably in one of
the intelligence agencies.

596
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:54,718
A mole.

597
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:58,382
His last known
contact...

598
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,847
is an American
now in Budapest.

599
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,353
What I want from you
is to get close to him.

600
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,523
And establish trust.

601
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,775
And then you bring me
the name of the mole.

602
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,840
You follow the trail
wherever it leads you...

603
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,606
you sacrifice whatever
needs to be sacrificed.

604
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,784
You understand?

605
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,988
Yes, Uncle.

606
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,944
This is for you.

607
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,951
What is it?

608
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,785
New passport.
Credentials.

609
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,171
New name.
Katerina Zubkova.

610
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:32,752
And what reward
will they give you?

611
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,169
A promotion?

612
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,971
I understand
you are angry with me.

613
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,803
You sent me
to whore school.

614
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,719
I made you special again.

615
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:44,264
You have a gift.
Like me.

616
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:45,681
You see through people.

617
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:47,392
You see them
for what they really are.

618
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,606
And you always stay
one step ahead.

619
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:50,940
You do this for me,

620
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,817
and I'll let you go
if that's what you want.

621
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,948
But I feel you won't.

622
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,244
This is what
you were meant to do.

623
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,247
Yes, Uncle.

624
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:02,991
Let's eat.

625
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:04,580
Excuse me.

626
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,051
- We'll have two of everything.
- Yes, sir.

627
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:09,418
How does that sound?

628
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:36,034
Welcome to Budapest.

629
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:01,720
You must be Katerina.

630
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:02,898
Hello.

631
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:05,353
You're pretty.

632
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:14,241
I'll show you to your room.
Bathroom is down the hall.

633
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:18,492
I'm in there.
And you're through here.

634
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:24,957
I keep my door locked.

635
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,834
If I were you,
I'd do the same.

636
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:28,919
Stay out of my way,
and I stay out of yours,

637
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,421
and we should
get along fine.

638
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:32,677
Is that clear?
Yes.

639
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:36,681
I imagine tomorrow you'll
meet our station chief.

640
00:51:37,853 --> 00:51:38,968
A warning.

641
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:40,887
Chief Volontov
never met an idea

642
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:42,346
he didn't want
to take credit for.

643
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:45,313
And he likes to try it on
with the new girls...

644
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:47,727
when he's not
drooling after strippers.

645
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:49,570
He's going to like you.

646
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,946
Tell me about the American.

647
00:51:51,116 --> 00:51:53,403
He's not exactly
match-fit.

648
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,990
He swims
every afternoon.

649
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:59,702
Logs his time.
But he drinks too much.

650
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:04,378
He looks
at pornography.

651
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:06,838
Nothing out of
the ordinary.

652
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:11,003
Anal. Threesomes.

653
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,638
Usually two men on a girl.

654
00:52:16,018 --> 00:52:17,929
No relationships
to speak of.

655
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:20,812
A few girls he's paid,
couple of times...

656
00:52:20,982 --> 00:52:22,723
but then he feels guilty
and over-tips.

657
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:26,021
Perhaps we'd have
more success

658
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:28,104
if we knew
what we were looking for.

659
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:31,491
I'm offering the complete
cooperation of my office.

660
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,118
And in exchange,
I hope that you will...

661
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:38,285
keep us informed
of your progress.

662
00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:39,824
Of course.

663
00:53:19,002 --> 00:53:20,037
Need a hand?

664
00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:21,918
No, it's all right.

665
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:23,374
Want it to be good?

666
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:24,963
Let me help you.

667
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:27,545
Come on, give it to me.

668
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:34,591
Every human being
is a puzzle of need.

669
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:39,137
Learn how to be
the missing piece,

670
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:41,268
and they will
give you everything.

671
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,944
You thought
you were the only one?

672
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,786
We'll always be their whores.

673
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,670
Unless, of course,
we have something they want.

674
00:54:11,557 --> 00:54:13,969
If I were you,
I'd find something.

675
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:18,832
The pool is open
from 6:00 in the morning...

676
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,767
until 10:00 at night
from Monday through Friday.

677
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:22,807
From 6:00 to 8:00
on weekends.

678
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:27,230
No personal belongings
are allowed on the pool deck.

679
00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:32,239
I made a mistake.
Sorry.

680
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:35,955
Hand in your membership
card here for a locker key.

681
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,207
You get your card back
when you return the key.

682
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:40,785
Any questions?

683
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:41,999
No.

684
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:34,680
How did you know
I was Russian?

685
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:36,094
It was just a guess.

686
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:39,649
You speak well.

687
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:41,224
I used to live
in Moscow.

688
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:43,063
Do you miss it?

689
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:44,727
You know, food, people.

690
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:46,271
So what do you do
in Budapest?

691
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:49,067
I'm a translator
at the Embassy. You?

692
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:51,201
Commercial counselor.
Medical supplies.

693
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:53,291
I've never seen you at any
of the Embassy events.

694
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,456
I haven't been here long.

695
00:55:56,627 --> 00:55:57,627
Excuse me.

696
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,677
Blonde suits you,
by the way.

697
00:56:08,723 --> 00:56:10,009
Have we met?

698
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,303
I thought I saw you
in the pool yesterday,

699
00:56:12,393 --> 00:56:14,259
and on the tram,
I think.

700
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,973
You're mistaken.

701
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:20,503
Would you like to get
something to eat with me?

702
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:22,360
I know a Turkish place
at the station.

703
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,862
It's a shithole,
but the food's pretty good.

704
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:26,405
Maybe you know it.

705
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,365
I'm not hungry.

706
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:30,368
Perhaps another time?

707
00:56:36,836 --> 00:56:38,396
I'll see you
at the pool, I guess.

708
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:14,115
Your ID is missing.

709
00:57:16,044 --> 00:57:17,409
Are you sure?

710
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:19,750
Yeah. I put it
there myself.

711
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:23,170
Sorry, I'll have to
make you a new one.

712
00:57:23,468 --> 00:57:25,175
I've got your picture
on file.

713
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:26,426
Take your time.

714
00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:31,013
She came in under
the name Katerina Zubkova.

715
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:34,519
Registered as a translator
for the Embassy.

716
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:38,808
But her real name
is Dominika Egorova.

717
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:42,023
She used to dance
with the Bolshoi.

718
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:44,733
There's officially no record
of her being SVR...

719
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:47,029
but that's bullshit.
She's here for Marble. I know it.

720
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:49,284
Stay away from her.
I think she's valuable.

721
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:50,473
And now you think
she's recruitable?

722
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:51,497
Maybe.

723
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:53,072
Okay, that's not
what you're here for.

724
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,740
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

725
00:57:54,919 --> 00:57:56,080
Play dead.

726
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:57,288
Put the ticks to sleep

727
00:57:57,379 --> 00:57:58,607
and pray Marble
sticks his head out again...

728
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:00,751
so we can get him back into play.
That's the priority.

729
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:03,216
She's Ivan Egorov's niece.

730
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,640
Deputy director of the SVR?

731
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:11,470
I have nieces.

732
00:58:11,645 --> 00:58:12,645
Spend most of their time

733
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:14,140
exposing themselves
on the Internet.

734
00:58:14,314 --> 00:58:15,975
Why would she use
her real name?

735
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:17,435
Because
she's an innocent.

736
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,977
Or because
it's a provocation.

737
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,090
Both of which are very good
reasons to stay away from her.

738
00:58:22,114 --> 00:58:23,926
I think there's
something about this girl.

739
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,408
She's gold. I know it.

740
00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:30,070
Okay. See what
you can find out.

741
00:58:31,499 --> 00:58:32,785
Thanks.
Just go slow, all right?

742
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:33,959
All right.

743
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:35,126
Nate?
Mmm-hmm?

744
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,170
If she does let you fuck her,
she's definitely SVR...

745
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,082
because she's
way out of your league.

746
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:48,343
I need you
to get me on the list

747
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:49,873
for an event
at the American Embassy.

748
00:58:49,977 --> 00:58:51,183
I could do that.

749
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,311
Thank you.
If...

750
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:56,018
you give me
a progress report in return.

751
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:57,982
I've established contact.

752
00:58:58,152 --> 00:58:59,187
Contact?

753
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:01,315
I thought you'd be
on your back by now.

754
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:03,692
You know...

755
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:06,946
there were always stories
about Sparrows.

756
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:11,322
Capable of performing
tricks on a man's mind.

757
00:59:11,959 --> 00:59:13,950
Not to mention,
the rest of him.

758
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:17,378
A magic pussy.

759
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:19,171
That's what they say.

760
00:59:20,217 --> 00:59:21,548
Perhaps I will find out.

761
00:59:24,096 --> 00:59:25,131
Ooh!

762
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:28,135
Just a bit of fun.

763
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:30,637
But the offer stands.

764
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:33,266
If you need help,
don't hesitate to ask.

765
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:38,726
After all,
everyone needs a friend.

766
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,381
The success
of these efforts...

767
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:41,816
will be critical for securing

768
00:59:41,906 --> 00:59:44,319
Hungary's economic ties
with its neighbors.

769
00:59:44,493 --> 00:59:46,700
This is clearly a moment of
rapid change in the world...

770
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:50,535
making it imperative for each
region to stay competitive.

771
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,958
Thanks to the Hungarian
President for hosting us...

772
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:56,043
and to the American Ambassador
for co-hosting.

773
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,121
Lastly, I would
like to thank

774
00:59:58,215 --> 01:00:00,423
my chief of staff,
Stephanie Boucher...

775
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:02,835
without whose hard work
we would not be here tonight.

776
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:04,013
Stephanie.

777
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,570
Dominika Egorova.

778
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:31,615
You know my name?

779
01:00:31,918 --> 01:00:32,999
You told me.

780
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:36,412
You stole my ID
from the pool.

781
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:39,665
That would be illegal.

782
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:41,881
Were you just
looking for me?

783
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:44,421
I'd know where
to find you if I was.

784
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:45,765
Listen, I'm curious,

785
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:47,243
did you want me to know that
you were following me...

786
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:49,053
or are you just real clumsy?

787
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:50,998
You Americans
always think the rest of us

788
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,854
are so interested in you,
don't you?

789
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,140
So what made you wanna
become a translator?

790
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,934
I'm sure if you know
my name,

791
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,689
you found out
other things about me.

792
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,303
I have wondered
what it would be like

793
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,634
to pursue somethin'
your whole life...

794
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,365
and then have it
ripped away from you.

795
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,701
What's it like?

796
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,454
Yeah, how does it
make you feel?

797
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,706
What does it matter?

798
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,333
My mother is unwell.

799
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,743
If I work
for the government,

800
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,545
the state helps me
take care of her.

801
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:18,415
My uncle
helped me get the job.

802
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,299
Your uncle is
a very powerful man.

803
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,005
In my country,
if you don't matter

804
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,134
to the men in power,
you do not matter.

805
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,598
Is it so different
in your country?

806
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:28,888
It's supposed to be, but...

807
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:31,678
Are you a patriot?

808
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,561
No.

809
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,020
Then why do you do
what you do?

810
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:37,684
Beats selling tires.

811
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:39,857
Have you ever sold tires?

812
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:41,067
No.

813
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,199
Then you can't know,
can you?

814
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,120
Good point.

815
01:01:47,748 --> 01:01:49,409
Hey, I'd like
to see you again.

816
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:52,041
Why, are we going
to become friends?

817
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:53,868
Is that what you want?

818
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,086
I don't have any.

819
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,545
There's a Russian restaurant
right by the opera.

820
01:01:58,719 --> 01:01:59,834
Have dinner with me there.

821
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,132
Tomorrow at 8:00.

822
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:04,307
Okay.

823
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:24,742
Marta?

824
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:30,837
You're home.

825
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:34,585
That was him at the Embassy.

826
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:35,965
It was.

827
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:37,876
Playing hard to get,
are you?

828
01:04:38,304 --> 01:04:40,295
No substitute
for a good old-fashioned

829
01:04:40,389 --> 01:04:41,550
blow job in my experience.

830
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:42,885
He's not like that.

831
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:49,023
What's this?

832
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:50,306
A copy of the report

833
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,061
Volontov sent to Moscow
three days ago.

834
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,771
Apparently,
you've made an enemy.

835
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:12,290
Evening.

836
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:13,751
Good evening, sir.

837
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,070
This is a coincidence?

838
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:42,824
You were right.
I do need a friend.

839
01:05:44,624 --> 01:05:46,581
Everyone needs a friend.

840
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,327
I need you to
send a report...

841
01:05:50,505 --> 01:05:52,497
that you are impressed
with the progress

842
01:05:52,591 --> 01:05:53,831
I've made with Nash.

843
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:56,717
I need more time.

844
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:58,673
And I would owe you.

845
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:03,220
How do I know
you pay your debts?

846
01:06:13,113 --> 01:06:15,354
You were right
about Sparrows.

847
01:06:15,532 --> 01:06:17,364
We are special.

848
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:19,741
Do you know
what they teach us?

849
01:06:19,911 --> 01:06:23,199
How to determine
what a lover needs.

850
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:25,080
And I knew what you needed

851
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:27,580
from the first time
I ever saw you.

852
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:32,547
Someone not to laugh
at your microscopic prick.

853
01:06:37,805 --> 01:06:39,045
Get your hands off me.

854
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,427
Look at the camera
over my left shoulder.

855
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:44,014
Tomorrow you will write
a favorable report,

856
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:46,061
or I'll have you
arrested for assault.

857
01:06:47,065 --> 01:06:50,729
You'll be recalled to Moscow,
and your career will be over.

858
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:52,518
Good night.

859
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:34,907
Hello?

860
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:36,219
This is an automated test

861
01:07:36,243 --> 01:07:37,323
of your digital phone line.

862
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:39,068
Sorry for the interruption.

863
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:41,849
- Alpha.
- Charlie.

864
01:07:41,873 --> 01:07:43,433
- Zero.
- Whiskey.

865
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,595
Vienna.

866
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,652
It's Dominika.

867
01:08:16,535 --> 01:08:18,196
Uh, come on up.

868
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,418
Hey.
Can I have a drink?

869
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:29,371
Come in.

870
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,010
Whiskey.

871
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:36,048
Thank you.

872
01:08:43,897 --> 01:08:45,763
So do you wanna tell me
what happened?

873
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,225
My pig boss is insulted

874
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,776
I don't want
to sleep with him.

875
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:52,482
What's his name?

876
01:08:53,907 --> 01:08:55,318
Maxim Volontov.

877
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:56,905
I've heard of him.

878
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,746
How did you know
where I live?

879
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:21,134
Why did you leave Russia?

880
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:23,978
I screwed up at work.

881
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:29,935
Why would a CIA officer fire
his gun in a public park?

882
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:33,238
I did it for a friend.

883
01:09:34,076 --> 01:09:38,616
Because I knew what they would do to him.
So do you.

884
01:09:55,598 --> 01:09:57,339
What do you want,
Dominika?

885
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:05,561
I think you should probably
go home and figure it out.

886
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:15,824
See you tomorrow.

887
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,781
You know where to find me.

888
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:04,183
Katerina.
You changed your hair.

889
01:12:07,196 --> 01:12:08,732
I will leave you.

890
01:12:08,906 --> 01:12:10,067
Nice to meet you.

891
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:16,490
Would you prefer a drink?

892
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:17,996
Sure. But I don't
have much time.

893
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,703
I didn't know you were coming.
What's the occasion?

894
01:12:20,877 --> 01:12:22,788
Do I need one?

895
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,624
I'm on my way to Vienna
for a meeting...

896
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,335
and I thought
I'd look in on you.

897
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,590
What happened to your eye?

898
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,421
I bumped it at the pool.

899
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:33,553
You have any news about
our American friend?

900
01:12:33,723 --> 01:12:36,466
He's begun to lower
his guard around me.

901
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,519
He told me about
what happened at the park

902
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,391
after I established trust.

903
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,482
Hmm.

904
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,198
So how was he?
Unmemorable.

905
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:52,900
But he's handsome, right?

906
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,193
Is he?

907
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,288
Is there anything
out of the ordinary

908
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:02,709
that you would
like to report?

909
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,292
If you lose contact...

910
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,547
or if he goes missing
for a day or more...

911
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:08,834
you need to let me know,

912
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:11,044
because our superiors
are getting impatient.

913
01:13:11,222 --> 01:13:12,929
I have something for you.

914
01:13:15,435 --> 01:13:16,721
Something new.

915
01:13:17,437 --> 01:13:19,178
A case
with great potential.

916
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,477
I thought I made it very clear
you only have one mission.

917
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:25,109
A Russian agent inside
the American government...

918
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:27,020
is always of value,
is it not?

919
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,607
Marta and I are developing
the asset together.

920
01:13:30,784 --> 01:13:32,366
A senator's
chief of staff.

921
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:34,197
And she is willing
to cooperate?

922
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:36,112
She's compromised.
She has no choice.

923
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,122
When do you see her again?
In London.

924
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:41,250
In a week's time.
But we need more money.

925
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:42,627
Blackmail will
not be enough

926
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,296
to establish
long-term exchange.

927
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:45,672
What did you have in mind?

928
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:47,549
$250,000.

929
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:52,421
That is a lot of money.

930
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:54,427
But you can get it.

931
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:57,972
Hmm.

932
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:03,228
I have to leave.

933
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,187
Oh, I forgot my coat.

934
01:14:08,366 --> 01:14:09,447
I'll get it.

935
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:28,175
Thank you.

936
01:14:46,197 --> 01:14:50,317
I've waited a lifetime
for something like Swan.

937
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:52,861
I worked a year
developing her.

938
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:55,196
She's not yours to trade.

939
01:14:55,374 --> 01:14:57,741
Now you have the money
to make the exchange.

940
01:14:57,918 --> 01:14:59,784
I will make sure
you get the credit.

941
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,420
I just need
more time. Please.

942
01:15:02,589 --> 01:15:03,704
What do they have on you?

943
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:05,749
I saw something
I was not supposed to.

944
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:07,383
What did you see?

945
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:11,388
You don't get Swan
for free.

946
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:14,050
I was there the night
they killed Dmitri Ustinov.

947
01:15:14,227 --> 01:15:16,639
For telling you that,
they would cut my throat.

948
01:15:18,523 --> 01:15:19,684
Will you help me?

949
01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:22,399
I don't have
a fucking choice.

950
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:19,577
What would you give me

951
01:16:19,671 --> 01:16:21,912
if I told you how to
get rid of Katerina?

952
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,051
What do you want?

953
01:16:30,308 --> 01:16:32,265
Oh, am I too late?

954
01:16:33,478 --> 01:16:34,513
Sorry, we're closed.

955
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,647
You can come back in the morning.
We open at 9:00.

956
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:38,009
I'm not going
to be here tomorrow.

957
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:39,773
Is there any way
you can make an exception?

958
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,271
Please. I wanted
to open an account

959
01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:43,477
for a family member...

960
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:44,861
in case anything
happens to me.

961
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:46,238
I can't let you in.

962
01:16:46,408 --> 01:16:47,990
Well, maybe you could
get the form,

963
01:16:48,077 --> 01:16:49,442
and I could buy you
a coffee?

964
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,078
We could
fill them out together.

965
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,268
Do you have your passport,
and all the information?

966
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,412
Yes. Yes,
I have it all here.

967
01:16:56,585 --> 01:16:58,826
Okay. Excellent.
Oh, thank you.

968
01:17:24,824 --> 01:17:25,859
Marta?

969
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,369
Marta?

970
01:17:58,234 --> 01:18:00,066
Ever been on a farm?

971
01:18:00,778 --> 01:18:04,567
That's what it smells like,
when you butcher an animal.

972
01:18:05,283 --> 01:18:07,320
I took my time with her.

973
01:18:08,411 --> 01:18:12,531
So you would see what happens
when you tell secrets.

974
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:15,075
Please, please, please.

975
01:18:15,252 --> 01:18:17,289
This is your only warning.

976
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:19,839
Now...

977
01:18:20,591 --> 01:18:21,797
call the police.

978
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:32,889
Where the fuck
have you been?

979
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:41,693
Close your door.

980
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:50,620
So, Marble surfaced.

981
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:52,781
Jesus Christ. Here?

982
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:54,376
Vienna.

983
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:55,829
You don't say anything?

984
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,243
What is that?

985
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:58,582
It's a warning.

986
01:19:00,259 --> 01:19:01,920
She is a fucking Sparrow.

987
01:19:02,094 --> 01:19:03,710
Told you she was
way out of your league.

988
01:19:03,887 --> 01:19:06,128
I think
she's still recruitable.

989
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:07,742
Now that we know
what we're dealing with,

990
01:19:07,766 --> 01:19:08,847
maybe even more so.

991
01:19:09,017 --> 01:19:10,052
If she's a Sparrow...

992
01:19:10,227 --> 01:19:12,559
we can't trust a fucking word
that comes out of her mouth.

993
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:15,937
Yeah.

994
01:19:17,026 --> 01:19:18,107
When?

995
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:20,944
And you came home
to find her like this?

996
01:19:21,322 --> 01:19:23,063
Yes.

997
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,155
This wasn't
just a break-in.

998
01:19:28,329 --> 01:19:30,616
This was torture,
punishment.

999
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:33,122
Any idea why someone
would do this to her?

1000
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:38,754
What happened
to your eye?

1001
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,376
Did you
get along with her?

1002
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:47,676
You seem upset.
Of course I'm fucking upset!

1003
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:56,890
You know something,
don't you?

1004
01:19:58,236 --> 01:20:00,773
Whoever it is
you're shielding...

1005
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:03,154
whoever you are
scared of...

1006
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,740
we can protect you.
May I go?

1007
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:12,782
I'm assuming
you guys were pretty close.

1008
01:20:14,378 --> 01:20:16,665
You must be pretty scared.

1009
01:20:17,173 --> 01:20:18,834
For yourself.

1010
01:20:19,008 --> 01:20:20,248
When I was in Moscow,

1011
01:20:20,343 --> 01:20:23,631
they talked about a program
that Khrushchev had set up.

1012
01:20:23,805 --> 01:20:28,049
Young officers. Trained to
seduce and manipulate.

1013
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:29,849
They called 'em Sparrows.

1014
01:20:30,604 --> 01:20:32,186
That is what
she was, right?

1015
01:20:32,564 --> 01:20:34,521
The thing I just cannot
wrap my head around...

1016
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:37,683
is why a man
would put his niece

1017
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:39,360
through somethin'
like that.

1018
01:20:46,829 --> 01:20:50,072
I was told
to take a man to a hotel.

1019
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:51,739
To get information.

1020
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:56,453
They said he was
an enemy of the state.

1021
01:20:57,131 --> 01:20:58,293
And in exchange,

1022
01:20:58,384 --> 01:21:00,546
my mother would get
the doctor she needed.

1023
01:21:02,846 --> 01:21:06,680
Instead, they cut his throat,
and he died on top of me.

1024
01:21:09,853 --> 01:21:13,391
There could be no witnesses,
so my uncle gave me a choice.

1025
01:21:13,565 --> 01:21:16,649
Die, or become a Sparrow.

1026
01:21:17,362 --> 01:21:19,069
What they did to Marta
was a message.

1027
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,319
They cut her open to show me
what they'll do to me...

1028
01:21:21,449 --> 01:21:22,849
if I don't give them
what they want.

1029
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,988
What do they want?
A name.

1030
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:26,526
They think you're
running an agent.

1031
01:21:26,913 --> 01:21:28,153
What do you think?

1032
01:21:28,331 --> 01:21:29,696
I don't care.

1033
01:21:30,835 --> 01:21:32,576
I just want
my mother to be safe.

1034
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:34,564
The men that you work for,
men like your uncle...

1035
01:21:34,588 --> 01:21:36,708
they'll never let you go
no matter what you give them.

1036
01:21:36,799 --> 01:21:38,540
It's how they function.

1037
01:21:38,717 --> 01:21:40,833
You only matter because of
what you can do for them.

1038
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,753
You don't exist
unless they say so.

1039
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:49,056
And not just now. I mean,
when you were dancing...

1040
01:21:50,313 --> 01:21:51,599
you were dancing for them.

1041
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,138
Because they were
lettin' you.

1042
01:21:53,316 --> 01:21:54,522
I mean,
you see it now, right?

1043
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:57,435
You belonged to them,
pretty much your whole life.

1044
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:04,697
So, Dominika, work with me.

1045
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:08,493
Make this something
that you own

1046
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,790
for the first time
in your life.

1047
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,629
And make them
fucking pay.

1048
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,163
What is it
you want from me?

1049
01:22:17,341 --> 01:22:18,957
Whatever you can give us.

1050
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,047
But if I had my choice...

1051
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:22,803
access to your uncle.

1052
01:22:23,182 --> 01:22:24,764
Be your spy?

1053
01:22:25,225 --> 01:22:28,513
Is that any different
from being his?

1054
01:22:28,687 --> 01:22:31,520
Yeah, because I would never
ask you to do what he did.

1055
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,397
Nothing's worth that.

1056
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:36,855
I need to sleep.

1057
01:22:37,029 --> 01:22:38,646
Why don't you
take my room?

1058
01:22:46,748 --> 01:22:49,706
You know, you asked me why
I fired the gun in Moscow?

1059
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:53,665
Well, the man I was protecting
had everything to lose.

1060
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:56,080
He was benefiting
from the system...

1061
01:22:56,258 --> 01:22:58,875
but when he saw what was
happening in his name...

1062
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:01,135
he didn't just say
that he didn't know.

1063
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:03,672
He risked his life.
He risked everything.

1064
01:23:03,849 --> 01:23:06,011
He didn't deserve to die
in a cellar somewhere.

1065
01:23:06,185 --> 01:23:07,801
If you do this...

1066
01:23:07,978 --> 01:23:10,515
I'll do everything in my
power to protect you.

1067
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,757
Can I trust you?

1068
01:23:44,183 --> 01:23:45,800
I promise you can.

1069
01:23:56,405 --> 01:23:58,271
Wait. Wait, don't.

1070
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,351
Hey.

1071
01:25:08,064 --> 01:25:09,180
Thank you.

1072
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:17,188
I danced
my first solo to this.

1073
01:25:18,492 --> 01:25:19,948
It's Grieg.

1074
01:25:20,952 --> 01:25:25,413
I was so nervous the night before,
I couldn't sleep.

1075
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:29,167
And I played this music
in my room...

1076
01:25:30,296 --> 01:25:33,459
and, after I fell asleep,
I dreamed that...

1077
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:37,672
the music was color,
and I could paint...

1078
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:42,511
over all the audiences'
faces with my hands.

1079
01:25:54,697 --> 01:25:57,109
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

1080
01:26:00,912 --> 01:26:03,779
But I'm really very glad
that you're here.

1081
01:26:03,957 --> 01:26:05,118
Me too.

1082
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:06,948
Are you sure about this?

1083
01:26:08,586 --> 01:26:10,702
Okay. Well, listen.

1084
01:26:15,593 --> 01:26:17,301
This is what
I want you to do.

1085
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:19,178
Go back to your
normal routine.

1086
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:23,433
Go into work,
and write a report about me.

1087
01:26:23,602 --> 01:26:26,720
About the time we spent,
and how close we've gotten.

1088
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:30,231
Say that I'm a fool,
and you've got me on the hook.

1089
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:33,440
Tell them that I'm ambitious,
but that I drink.

1090
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:35,383
And that I have something
to prove to my father...

1091
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,819
which means
I will make a mistake.

1092
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,984
Then I need you to go home.

1093
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,028
Police will be finished
with your apartment

1094
01:26:42,122 --> 01:26:43,237
by this evening.

1095
01:26:43,415 --> 01:26:44,575
Then just wait for my signal.

1096
01:26:48,962 --> 01:26:49,963
Hello?

1097
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:01,552
I'm just gonna
ask you some

1098
01:27:01,642 --> 01:27:03,303
routine questions to begin.

1099
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:04,593
Name?

1100
01:27:04,771 --> 01:27:06,228
Dominika Egorova.

1101
01:27:07,357 --> 01:27:09,098
Did you eat breakfast
this morning?

1102
01:27:09,276 --> 01:27:10,276
Yes.

1103
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,646
Are you an officer

1104
01:27:11,737 --> 01:27:13,353
of the Russian
Intelligence Service?

1105
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,611
Yes.

1106
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,439
Are you here because

1107
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:18,774
CIA Officer Nate Nash
recruited you?

1108
01:27:18,952 --> 01:27:19,987
Yes.

1109
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:24,360
Are you willing to work
for the American government?

1110
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:25,536
Yes.

1111
01:27:26,044 --> 01:27:28,911
And you intend to
give us genuine information?

1112
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,461
Yes or no?

1113
01:27:30,548 --> 01:27:31,548
Yes.

1114
01:27:31,633 --> 01:27:32,693
Why would you
do that?

1115
01:27:32,717 --> 01:27:34,333
I thought it was
just yes or no?

1116
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:36,752
I'm just curious.

1117
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:38,921
I know the nature
of the men I work for.

1118
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:40,260
So why work for them?

1119
01:27:40,434 --> 01:27:42,425
They gave me no choice.
I have a question.

1120
01:27:42,603 --> 01:27:44,970
You only spike
when Nate's name comes up.

1121
01:27:45,147 --> 01:27:47,263
Did you engage in sexual
intercourse with him?

1122
01:27:47,441 --> 01:27:48,502
Hey, that's...
Take it easy.

1123
01:27:48,526 --> 01:27:49,586
Because that's
what you do, right?

1124
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:50,610
Marty? Marty.

1125
01:27:50,694 --> 01:27:51,755
That's what
you're trained for.

1126
01:27:51,779 --> 01:27:52,839
Anybody ever
tell you that...

1127
01:27:52,863 --> 01:27:54,353
Why do you need
to know, bratok?

1128
01:27:55,115 --> 01:27:56,115
Big brother?

1129
01:27:56,785 --> 01:27:58,241
Please answer the question.

1130
01:27:58,411 --> 01:28:00,306
We'd need to know if
you're emotionally involved.

1131
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,411
The answer is no.

1132
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:06,867
So, are you satisfied?

1133
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:09,245
Yeah.
If I am to work for you...

1134
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:12,505
I will need money transferred
to a bank account in Vienna.

1135
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:15,840
$30,000 to start.

1136
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,201
I don't know
what you and Nate discussed...

1137
01:28:19,225 --> 01:28:20,744
but I think we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves.

1138
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:22,600
We'd have to see
what you brought us.

1139
01:28:22,687 --> 01:28:24,143
If it's significant...

1140
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:26,099
What about a senator's
chief of staff?

1141
01:28:26,274 --> 01:28:27,560
Excuse me?

1142
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:30,066
A chief of staff
run by the SVR?

1143
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:32,274
She's agreed
to sell information

1144
01:28:32,364 --> 01:28:33,900
on a satellite
defense system.

1145
01:28:34,074 --> 01:28:36,281
I'm to fly to London on
Friday to meet with her.

1146
01:28:38,829 --> 01:28:41,241
Shall I provide you with
the account information?

1147
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,511
Oh, there she is.

1148
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:16,945
It's to the left.

1149
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:24,037
We'll get it.
We're good.

1150
01:29:36,014 --> 01:29:37,255
What are you doing here?

1151
01:29:37,433 --> 01:29:39,140
Thought you might
need some help

1152
01:29:39,226 --> 01:29:41,388
after what happened
to poor Marta.

1153
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:45,480
Of course, you were lucky
not to be harmed yourself.

1154
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,982
I appreciate your concern.

1155
01:29:48,152 --> 01:29:49,338
Though I do wonder how
Swan would react

1156
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:50,568
if she saw me with you.

1157
01:29:50,738 --> 01:29:52,069
Do you really
want to be the one

1158
01:29:52,156 --> 01:29:53,568
to blow
this whole operation?

1159
01:29:53,742 --> 01:29:56,780
Director Egorov would be
very displeased.

1160
01:29:57,454 --> 01:30:01,322
Go upstairs, room 624.
I'll call you if I need you.

1161
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,167
Go.

1162
01:30:19,352 --> 01:30:21,639
- Who the hell is that?
- He's got a key.

1163
01:30:21,813 --> 01:30:23,540
Did she say anybody else
was gonna be in that room?

1164
01:30:23,564 --> 01:30:26,977
No. I think that's...
Yeah, it's Volontov.

1165
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:28,896
That's her boss.

1166
01:30:36,662 --> 01:30:37,662
Vodka.

1167
01:30:56,516 --> 01:30:57,516
Do I know you?

1168
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,136
We have a friend
in common.

1169
01:31:00,896 --> 01:31:01,931
Where is she?

1170
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:04,939
Unfortunately, Marta
wasn't able to make it.

1171
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:06,357
So she sent me.

1172
01:31:08,446 --> 01:31:09,686
Oh.

1173
01:31:09,947 --> 01:31:11,358
I'll just be leaving.

1174
01:31:25,672 --> 01:31:27,834
You really think
I care if people know

1175
01:31:27,924 --> 01:31:29,255
who I'm meeting with?

1176
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:31,421
I think in this case,
you might.

1177
01:31:31,595 --> 01:31:34,338
Marta's a known
intelligence officer.

1178
01:31:34,515 --> 01:31:35,659
If photographs
of your relationship

1179
01:31:35,683 --> 01:31:36,683
were to go public...

1180
01:31:36,851 --> 01:31:39,559
you would lose your security
clearance, and your job.

1181
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:41,720
But I don't think
that any of that is necessary.

1182
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:43,639
You're here for business,
as am I.

1183
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:47,480
$250,000 was the figure
that you agreed upon.

1184
01:31:47,653 --> 01:31:50,691
Your daughter's tuition
payments are coming up.

1185
01:31:50,865 --> 01:31:53,073
I believe your ex-husband
is about to lose another job.

1186
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:57,491
Don't you think
you would be

1187
01:31:57,581 --> 01:31:59,288
more comfortable
in a private room?

1188
01:32:00,167 --> 01:32:01,749
Where do they find you?

1189
01:32:02,127 --> 01:32:03,162
Follow me.

1190
01:32:03,253 --> 01:32:04,453
All right, here we go.
Mmm-hmm.

1191
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:06,787
Let's get this show
on the road.

1192
01:32:10,428 --> 01:32:12,590
This is Colonel
Maxim Volontov.

1193
01:32:12,764 --> 01:32:15,347
He's the chief of
the Budapest rezidentura.

1194
01:32:16,518 --> 01:32:18,634
Make me a drink,
would you, Boris?

1195
01:32:20,438 --> 01:32:21,644
Let's get on with it.

1196
01:32:21,815 --> 01:32:23,556
You heard her.
Make her a drink.

1197
01:32:25,236 --> 01:32:26,236
So.

1198
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:28,565
Shall we proceed?

1199
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,571
I just want to be clear.

1200
01:32:30,658 --> 01:32:34,151
I'm here in a strictly
exploratory manner.

1201
01:32:34,328 --> 01:32:36,208
As long as what you have
to offer is of value...

1202
01:32:36,372 --> 01:32:38,113
I'm sure we will have
no difficulty.

1203
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:42,410
I'm chief of staff
to a United States senator.

1204
01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:45,504
Last person that had my job's
head of the fucking CIA.

1205
01:32:45,674 --> 01:32:48,336
Being in the room with me.

1206
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:50,171
Fucking value.

1207
01:32:51,263 --> 01:32:52,924
Oh, I think
she's drunk.

1208
01:32:53,098 --> 01:32:54,213
You think?
She's drunk.

1209
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:55,618
And I'm sure that
if you are as important

1210
01:32:55,642 --> 01:32:56,677
as you say you are...

1211
01:32:56,852 --> 01:32:59,436
then you don't
want to waste any time.

1212
01:32:59,605 --> 01:33:01,937
So, do you have
anything to sell?

1213
01:33:02,108 --> 01:33:04,566
I have the first
set of discs with me.

1214
01:33:05,403 --> 01:33:06,403
Today.

1215
01:33:06,863 --> 01:33:08,900
I just want to be clear
that I'm not doing this...

1216
01:33:09,073 --> 01:33:11,690
'cause I'm an ideologue
or pacifist

1217
01:33:11,784 --> 01:33:13,320
or something, you know.

1218
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:16,237
Where are the discs,
Stephanie?

1219
01:33:16,415 --> 01:33:17,450
Where's my money?

1220
01:33:17,624 --> 01:33:20,742
$250,000 per delivery
as agreed.

1221
01:33:30,262 --> 01:33:31,423
Yep.

1222
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:38,059
Oh, sorry.

1223
01:33:45,403 --> 01:33:47,644
I just need
to authenticate them.

1224
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:07,629
Why don't you give me
a real pour, huh, Boris?

1225
01:34:09,137 --> 01:34:11,378
Why don't you
get it yourself?

1226
01:34:12,515 --> 01:34:13,926
Don't mind if I do.

1227
01:34:24,654 --> 01:34:25,654
Everything all right?

1228
01:34:26,447 --> 01:34:28,188
I just have to wait
for them to load.

1229
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,842
Tell me, Boris.

1230
01:34:48,178 --> 01:34:52,172
You got a little babushka
back in Moscow?

1231
01:34:52,349 --> 01:34:53,464
'Course you do.

1232
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:56,306
Never ceases
to amaze me.

1233
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:59,187
Why are Russian women
so sexy?

1234
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:01,352
All the men
look like toads.

1235
01:35:11,452 --> 01:35:12,693
No, no, no.
No. Don't you.

1236
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,289
Where are you going?

1237
01:35:17,376 --> 01:35:18,707
I'm gonna go buy her
some time.

1238
01:35:20,212 --> 01:35:22,123
Why is it taking so long?
Just one more minute.

1239
01:35:23,382 --> 01:35:25,965
God,
who the fuck is that?

1240
01:35:28,972 --> 01:35:30,241
Just checking.

1241
01:35:30,265 --> 01:35:31,367
Is everything all right
with your room, sir?

1242
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:32,426
Fine.

1243
01:35:32,517 --> 01:35:34,133
Shall I
check the minibar?

1244
01:35:34,227 --> 01:35:35,227
There's no need.

1245
01:35:40,942 --> 01:35:42,432
Sorry to disturb you.

1246
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:55,829
It's finished. Everything
seems to be in order.

1247
01:35:57,043 --> 01:36:00,206
Good. Because if I have to spend
another minute with this cunt...

1248
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:03,172
I'm going to shoot her
in the face.

1249
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:05,336
Did she get 'em?

1250
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,671
She did.

1251
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:09,674
Nice accent.

1252
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,464
We'll leave now.

1253
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,257
You wait an hour
and then you go.

1254
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:15,426
We'll be in touch
for the next delivery.

1255
01:36:19,817 --> 01:36:21,023
Sure thing.

1256
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,256
Fuck it.

1257
01:36:56,523 --> 01:36:58,355
Oh. Oh. Oh.
She took the money.

1258
01:36:58,525 --> 01:36:59,890
She took the money!

1259
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:01,183
There you go.

1260
01:37:01,361 --> 01:37:03,721
Go get the discs, take
them back to the field office.

1261
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,146
I will follow as soon as
I get this squared away.

1262
01:38:26,326 --> 01:38:27,612
Yeah?

1263
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:35,204
Make the necessary
arrangements.

1264
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:38,085
Change of plans.
We go directly to Heathrow.

1265
01:38:38,255 --> 01:38:41,293
Moscow wants to
congratulate us in person.

1266
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:42,957
I'll call Director Egorov.

1267
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,421
No need.

1268
01:38:44,553 --> 01:38:47,671
Director Egorov
gave the order himself.

1269
01:38:47,765 --> 01:38:50,508
The discs
and your passport.

1270
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,480
Turn the car around.

1271
01:39:16,212 --> 01:39:17,247
Yeah?

1272
01:39:17,922 --> 01:39:19,128
Boucher is dead.

1273
01:39:19,882 --> 01:39:21,338
What are you
talking about?

1274
01:39:21,509 --> 01:39:23,626
Our guys outside went after
the money too early.

1275
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:26,842
She panicked. Stepped in
front of a fucking truck.

1276
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:29,256
What the fuck?

1277
01:39:29,434 --> 01:39:31,300
You think they had somebody
in the hotel?

1278
01:39:31,478 --> 01:39:32,478
I would've.

1279
01:39:32,646 --> 01:39:33,886
If they think
she tipped us off,

1280
01:39:33,981 --> 01:39:35,312
they're gonna kill her.

1281
01:39:35,482 --> 01:39:38,895
And Nate, the tail said
her car changed direction.

1282
01:39:39,069 --> 01:39:40,550
Looks like they're
headed to Heathrow.

1283
01:39:40,697 --> 01:39:44,315
Fuck, Trish. We fucked her.
We have fucked her!

1284
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:53,324
You look nervous.

1285
01:40:33,294 --> 01:40:34,955
They're entering
terminal two.

1286
01:40:35,046 --> 01:40:37,629
Looks like Aeroflot.

1287
01:40:57,152 --> 01:40:59,088
This is
a boarding announcement.

1288
01:40:59,112 --> 01:41:02,821
British European Airways
Flight 422 to Amsterdam...

1289
01:41:02,991 --> 01:41:05,199
will begin boarding shortly.

1290
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:08,829
Will all passengers please
proceed to Gate B-42.

1291
01:41:20,134 --> 01:41:21,135
Passport?

1292
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,005
Enjoy your flight.

1293
01:41:48,748 --> 01:41:49,748
Fuck!

1294
01:42:04,849 --> 01:42:07,181
I always had my doubts
about her.

1295
01:42:08,436 --> 01:42:09,676
She's my niece.

1296
01:42:09,854 --> 01:42:10,969
What?

1297
01:42:11,148 --> 01:42:12,308
My brother's daughter.

1298
01:42:12,774 --> 01:42:15,732
Give me the discs.
Please.

1299
01:42:16,903 --> 01:42:18,064
Of course.

1300
01:42:19,072 --> 01:42:20,904
Thank you.
Take him away.

1301
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:41,843
Did you give Ms. Boucher
to the Americans?

1302
01:42:44,975 --> 01:42:46,010
No.

1303
01:42:46,185 --> 01:42:47,391
Who did?

1304
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:48,767
I don't know.

1305
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:55,474
You can start.

1306
01:43:35,111 --> 01:43:36,943
Let's start again.

1307
01:43:37,614 --> 01:43:40,151
Did you give Boucher
to the Americans?

1308
01:43:41,827 --> 01:43:42,862
No.

1309
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:55,292
Did you give Boucher
to the Americans?

1310
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,131
No.

1311
01:44:12,818 --> 01:44:14,434
Are you working
for the Americans?

1312
01:44:15,404 --> 01:44:17,691
I love my country.

1313
01:44:35,925 --> 01:44:38,542
You gave Boucher
to the Americans.

1314
01:44:41,222 --> 01:44:42,713
For money?

1315
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:46,768
Or for the handsome American?

1316
01:44:48,647 --> 01:44:49,647
No.

1317
01:45:04,289 --> 01:45:07,077
Did you tell
the Americans about Boucher?

1318
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,116
No.

1319
01:45:16,469 --> 01:45:17,738
Last time.

1320
01:45:17,762 --> 01:45:19,969
Did you tell the Americans
about Boucher?

1321
01:45:20,056 --> 01:45:21,387
No.

1322
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:39,940
Last time.

1323
01:45:41,244 --> 01:45:43,656
Did you give Boucher
to the Americans?

1324
01:45:50,129 --> 01:45:51,210
No.

1325
01:46:32,173 --> 01:46:33,459
Please.

1326
01:46:34,676 --> 01:46:35,791
Make it stop.

1327
01:46:36,219 --> 01:46:37,801
You made a mistake.

1328
01:46:48,524 --> 01:46:49,980
It's not your fault.

1329
01:46:50,359 --> 01:46:52,441
But you have to tell them
what they want to know.

1330
01:46:52,778 --> 01:46:54,143
Please.

1331
01:46:54,864 --> 01:46:59,234
I can only protect you
if you tell me the truth.

1332
01:47:00,662 --> 01:47:01,993
The truth?

1333
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:07,871
There is no other mission
but this one.

1334
01:47:10,005 --> 01:47:13,249
Follow the trail
wherever it leads.

1335
01:47:13,676 --> 01:47:16,714
Sacrifice whatever
has to be sacrificed.

1336
01:47:16,971 --> 01:47:19,258
If they have
my real name...

1337
01:47:19,348 --> 01:47:20,838
if they have Swan...

1338
01:47:21,642 --> 01:47:23,508
if you torture me...

1339
01:47:24,353 --> 01:47:26,344
they will trust me.

1340
01:47:26,522 --> 01:47:27,887
How could they not?

1341
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,476
You don't want
to give up now.

1342
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:33,482
Send me back.

1343
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:35,237
Let me finish
what we started.

1344
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:41,076
Didn't I do well, Uncle?

1345
01:47:46,503 --> 01:47:47,789
Didn't I?

1346
01:48:07,483 --> 01:48:10,271
Oh, my child.

1347
01:48:11,654 --> 01:48:13,315
What happened to you?

1348
01:48:13,489 --> 01:48:16,902
I was questioned
by Security Services.

1349
01:48:17,076 --> 01:48:19,067
But they let you go?

1350
01:48:19,245 --> 01:48:21,704
Of course. I'm innocent.

1351
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,887
Chief Zakharov is expecting
you, Deputy Director.

1352
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,012
The president is furious
about the loss of Boucher.

1353
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:46,975
The mole would have
got her anyway.

1354
01:48:47,066 --> 01:48:48,602
Now we get something
in return.

1355
01:48:48,693 --> 01:48:51,606
His patience with your niece
has grown thin.

1356
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:53,733
The Americans
will trust her.

1357
01:48:53,907 --> 01:48:54,907
So you say.

1358
01:48:55,075 --> 01:48:56,941
I think Dominika
has had her chance.

1359
01:48:58,453 --> 01:49:00,535
It is my opinion
she has developed

1360
01:49:00,622 --> 01:49:02,784
feelings for the American.

1361
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,491
She has made
a fool of you, Ivan.

1362
01:49:06,378 --> 01:49:07,834
Send her back to Nash.

1363
01:49:08,005 --> 01:49:09,791
Have Matorin shadow her.

1364
01:49:09,965 --> 01:49:12,958
If she is compromised,
he will find out.

1365
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,711
The Americans
will respond.

1366
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:18,088
Nothing we can't weather.

1367
01:49:18,266 --> 01:49:20,007
And what of Dominika?

1368
01:49:20,476 --> 01:49:22,236
I leave that
decision to her uncle.

1369
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:26,639
Shall we tell the president
you prioritized...

1370
01:49:26,733 --> 01:49:28,850
the safety of your niece
over the mission?

1371
01:49:29,028 --> 01:49:31,019
If she's compromised...

1372
01:49:32,823 --> 01:49:36,282
I promise you,
she will be eliminated.

1373
01:49:38,037 --> 01:49:39,948
Thank you, Ivan.

1374
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,202
You're welcome,
Chief Zakharov.

1375
01:49:46,046 --> 01:49:47,878
Enjoy your night.

1376
01:50:02,688 --> 01:50:04,474
I'd ask you
how you got in,

1377
01:50:04,565 --> 01:50:06,681
but this is what
we taught you, isn't it?

1378
01:50:07,985 --> 01:50:10,397
Did they grant my request?

1379
01:50:10,571 --> 01:50:12,312
Yes, they did.

1380
01:50:39,894 --> 01:50:41,384
You were right.

1381
01:50:42,605 --> 01:50:44,095
I am like you, Uncle.

1382
01:51:20,645 --> 01:51:21,851
Oh, God.

1383
01:51:23,064 --> 01:51:24,647
Oh, thank God.

1384
01:51:28,654 --> 01:51:31,112
You know
what this looks like, right?

1385
01:51:32,575 --> 01:51:35,738
They just let you go?
Why would they do that?

1386
01:51:35,911 --> 01:51:38,994
Because I told them
that you would trust me now.

1387
01:51:39,498 --> 01:51:41,866
Enough to give me
the name of the mole.

1388
01:51:44,463 --> 01:51:46,750
But you know
that I can't do that.

1389
01:51:46,923 --> 01:51:48,163
Of course I do.

1390
01:51:49,468 --> 01:51:50,799
So what next, then?

1391
01:51:50,969 --> 01:51:52,835
I want to go
to America...

1392
01:51:53,555 --> 01:51:55,546
where I can be safe.
Please.

1393
01:51:57,392 --> 01:51:59,009
All right.
And my mother?

1394
01:51:59,687 --> 01:52:02,270
It'll take some time,
but we can get her out, yeah.

1395
01:52:02,857 --> 01:52:04,848
And the money
that I was promised?

1396
01:52:05,026 --> 01:52:07,518
You'll get it.
$30,000 in a bank in Vienna.

1397
01:52:07,695 --> 01:52:09,815
We couldn't release payment
while you were in custody.

1398
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,525
It's not enough.

1399
01:52:12,367 --> 01:52:14,530
How much do you want?

1400
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:17,203
I need $250,000.

1401
01:52:18,082 --> 01:52:19,868
For resettlement.

1402
01:52:20,042 --> 01:52:21,042
Okay.

1403
01:52:22,878 --> 01:52:24,334
You're helping me.

1404
01:52:25,047 --> 01:52:27,709
For no obvious advantage.

1405
01:52:28,092 --> 01:52:30,424
It's not what I expected.

1406
01:52:30,594 --> 01:52:32,711
If I hadn't waved you off
at the airport,

1407
01:52:32,806 --> 01:52:34,342
what would you have done?

1408
01:52:34,516 --> 01:52:36,132
I would've killed him
for you.

1409
01:53:16,977 --> 01:53:18,092
Nate?

1410
01:53:25,862 --> 01:53:27,068
Nate?

1411
01:54:44,236 --> 01:54:45,978
Do you know
what this is?

1412
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:49,155
They use it
for skin grafting.

1413
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,065
Burn victims.

1414
01:54:51,911 --> 01:54:55,404
A blade so fine,
you barely bleed.

1415
01:54:55,498 --> 01:54:56,829
Do you know
how long it takes

1416
01:54:57,166 --> 01:54:59,407
to peel the skin
from a human being?

1417
01:54:59,585 --> 01:55:03,079
Hours. Even if you are
very good at it.

1418
01:55:04,383 --> 01:55:07,171
And I...
I take my time with it.

1419
01:55:08,929 --> 01:55:11,796
Layer by layer.

1420
01:55:13,725 --> 01:55:17,184
Until I see
the white of the bone.

1421
01:55:21,568 --> 01:55:23,900
You know
what we want to know...

1422
01:55:24,904 --> 01:55:28,067
but I won't stop until long
after you're ready to talk.

1423
01:55:28,741 --> 01:55:30,323
If you pass out,

1424
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:33,198
I will inject you
with a stimulant.

1425
01:55:33,371 --> 01:55:36,410
You'll stay conscious
until we're finished.

1426
01:56:06,281 --> 01:56:07,863
What's the name,
Nate?

1427
01:56:08,033 --> 01:56:10,776
What's the name?

1428
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,905
No?

1429
01:56:12,997 --> 01:56:14,408
You want more?

1430
01:56:14,915 --> 01:56:17,407
No. Please.

1431
01:56:17,585 --> 01:56:19,417
So we go deeper.

1432
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,340
No!

1433
01:56:37,147 --> 01:56:38,683
No?

1434
01:56:40,275 --> 01:56:42,562
Come on, Nate.
The name.

1435
01:56:42,653 --> 01:56:44,395
What's the name?

1436
01:56:46,783 --> 01:56:47,989
No?

1437
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:51,113
Give it to me.
Let me try.

1438
01:56:52,413 --> 01:56:54,199
Wait, wait.

1439
01:56:58,961 --> 01:57:01,078
Oh, God!

1440
01:57:10,224 --> 01:57:12,465
No?

1441
01:58:16,794 --> 01:58:17,875
Nate?

1442
01:58:18,129 --> 01:58:19,129
Nate.

1443
01:58:19,213 --> 01:58:22,296
Call the Embassy.
The Embassy.

1444
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,432
It was you who killed Matorin,
wasn't it?

1445
01:59:11,602 --> 01:59:12,763
I can explain.

1446
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:14,178
I'm sure you can.

1447
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,187
My wife had dreams
of being a dancer.

1448
01:59:19,486 --> 01:59:21,318
Long before I met her.

1449
01:59:21,738 --> 01:59:23,098
Of course
she was nothing on you...

1450
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:26,441
but she used to dance for me
in our living room.

1451
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:28,408
When she fell ill...

1452
01:59:29,079 --> 01:59:30,570
the Russian Embassy
in New York...

1453
01:59:30,748 --> 01:59:33,490
refused to let an American
doctor operate on her.

1454
01:59:34,877 --> 01:59:38,245
Some petty bureaucrat
I had offended...

1455
01:59:38,422 --> 01:59:40,413
sentenced her to death.

1456
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:42,673
What passes for power.

1457
01:59:45,054 --> 01:59:47,922
I know you gave
the Americans Boucher.

1458
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,465
Only so they
would trust me.

1459
01:59:49,643 --> 01:59:50,804
And now we
must trust you?

1460
01:59:58,694 --> 02:00:04,486
I was born three days after
Stalin was laid in state.

1461
02:00:05,785 --> 02:00:08,026
My father fought for him
during the war.

1462
02:00:09,664 --> 02:00:12,531
He was a party member,
we were privileged.

1463
02:00:16,462 --> 02:00:19,580
It took me years to realize
I had been born in a prison.

1464
02:00:19,757 --> 02:00:22,090
Prison makes a beast
out of a man.

1465
02:00:22,261 --> 02:00:25,219
I learned to cheat,
to lie...

1466
02:00:25,389 --> 02:00:27,721
to do to others
before they do to me.

1467
02:00:28,517 --> 02:00:32,556
To survive,
by any means.

1468
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:34,725
So I had to decide.

1469
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:37,983
Die in the prison
where I was born...

1470
02:00:39,362 --> 02:00:41,319
or choose another side.

1471
02:00:42,115 --> 02:00:44,072
Our clumsy
American friends...

1472
02:00:44,784 --> 02:00:48,527
for whom individual freedom
is at least an aspiration.

1473
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:53,954
So now you know.
I am the mole.

1474
02:00:55,004 --> 02:00:56,745
I am the man
you are looking for.

1475
02:00:56,923 --> 02:00:58,317
You're free to hand me over
to your uncle...

1476
02:00:58,341 --> 02:00:59,401
give the men
who did this to you

1477
02:00:59,425 --> 02:01:00,465
what they want
and go home.

1478
02:01:00,593 --> 02:01:02,550
Of course,
there is another path.

1479
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,960
What would that be?

1480
02:01:04,138 --> 02:01:06,630
After you turn me in,
you will be a hero...

1481
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:08,715
beyond suspicion.

1482
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:13,854
The ideal position
to take my place

1483
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:16,057
and continue my work
with the Americans.

1484
02:01:16,234 --> 02:01:18,066
Make your uncle
and his kind pay

1485
02:01:18,153 --> 02:01:19,689
for what they have done
to our country.

1486
02:01:19,863 --> 02:01:21,069
They'll kill you.

1487
02:01:21,531 --> 02:01:23,317
Something
will slay us all.

1488
02:01:25,285 --> 02:01:28,870
You have the power to decide
whether or not I die in vain.

1489
02:01:32,543 --> 02:01:35,626
You are better at this
than any of us.

1490
02:01:35,922 --> 02:01:40,541
This is the only way for you
to return to your mother.

1491
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:45,130
You sent Matorin,
didn't you?

1492
02:01:45,307 --> 02:01:46,387
So I wouldn't
have a choice.

1493
02:01:47,309 --> 02:01:49,676
So that you would see.

1494
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:51,594
You never did.

1495
02:02:37,988 --> 02:02:38,988
Hello?

1496
02:02:40,741 --> 02:02:41,902
Hello?

1497
02:02:48,874 --> 02:02:49,874
I...

1498
02:03:13,942 --> 02:03:15,103
Stop.

1499
02:03:18,447 --> 02:03:19,937
Face the wall.

1500
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:25,903
I want to speak
with the Russian ambassador.

1501
02:03:26,081 --> 02:03:27,850
My name is Mikhail Sergev.

1502
02:03:27,874 --> 02:03:30,115
I am the ambassador
here in Budapest.

1503
02:03:30,293 --> 02:03:31,875
Unfortunately,
the Hungarians

1504
02:03:31,961 --> 02:03:33,918
are waiving
diplomatic immunity.

1505
02:03:34,089 --> 02:03:35,830
Call Zakharov.

1506
02:03:36,007 --> 02:03:39,420
Tell him
I have what he wants.

1507
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:43,136
I have the name
of the mole.

1508
02:03:43,307 --> 02:03:45,969
Why don't you tell me?
And I'll pass it along.

1509
02:03:49,105 --> 02:03:51,096
Listen to me
very carefully.

1510
02:03:51,273 --> 02:03:54,561
You are an errand boy.
I have an errand.

1511
02:03:54,735 --> 02:03:56,191
You will call Zakharov.

1512
02:03:56,278 --> 02:03:57,734
You will tell him
to make a trade.

1513
02:03:57,905 --> 02:03:59,522
Me for the mole.

1514
02:04:00,242 --> 02:04:02,153
Once it is arranged,

1515
02:04:02,244 --> 02:04:04,702
I will give the name
to Zakharov personally.

1516
02:04:06,248 --> 02:04:08,455
Do this right,
Mr. Ambassador,

1517
02:04:08,542 --> 02:04:10,499
and I might even tell them
it was your idea.

1518
02:04:12,337 --> 02:04:14,453
I'll see what I can do.

1519
02:04:17,844 --> 02:04:19,804
Thank you, Director Zakharov.

1520
02:04:19,846 --> 02:04:21,462
Speak of this
to no one else.

1521
02:04:21,639 --> 02:04:22,639
Yes, sir.

1522
02:04:29,522 --> 02:04:31,638
No loose ends.

1523
02:04:31,816 --> 02:04:34,104
Nothing that can come back
on the president.

1524
02:04:34,278 --> 02:04:35,939
And the girl?

1525
02:06:28,564 --> 02:06:30,055
You can uncuff her.

1526
02:06:35,155 --> 02:06:37,567
All right,
this is how this is gonna go.

1527
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:39,857
Nate will escort you
part of the way.

1528
02:06:40,202 --> 02:06:42,785
Once he confirms
the identity of our mole,

1529
02:06:42,871 --> 02:06:43,871
you go on alone.

1530
02:06:44,039 --> 02:06:46,156
You pass at the midpoint.
Don't stop.

1531
02:06:46,334 --> 02:06:48,746
Don't exchange a word.
Don't look back.

1532
02:06:51,089 --> 02:06:53,126
Anything goes wrong,
we abort.

1533
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:56,838
You try to run,
we are authorized to shoot.

1534
02:06:57,012 --> 02:06:59,299
We won't hesitate,
you understand?

1535
02:07:00,598 --> 02:07:02,384
All right, Nate,
it's time.

1536
02:07:12,862 --> 02:07:15,650
Your uncle
will be very proud.

1537
02:07:15,823 --> 02:07:16,984
He might be.

1538
02:07:23,707 --> 02:07:26,324
Are you gonna tell me
how you found out his name?

1539
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:28,242
Is it going
to make a difference?

1540
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:30,377
There is
an investigation.

1541
02:07:31,256 --> 02:07:32,917
They think it's me.

1542
02:07:34,301 --> 02:07:37,886
I guess that was the play
all along, huh?

1543
02:07:39,098 --> 02:07:40,588
Stop here.

1544
02:07:42,852 --> 02:07:44,058
I got him back for you.

1545
02:07:44,228 --> 02:07:45,764
You think
they're just gonna let him

1546
02:07:45,855 --> 02:07:47,141
make it across alive?

1547
02:07:47,315 --> 02:07:50,103
You realize you might have
just got him killed?

1548
02:07:53,447 --> 02:07:55,529
I think one day
you will understand.

1549
02:07:55,699 --> 02:07:58,407
No, I don't think I will.

1550
02:07:58,577 --> 02:08:00,659
Some things
can't be sacrificed.

1551
02:08:00,829 --> 02:08:02,661
We don't throw
people away.

1552
02:08:06,210 --> 02:08:07,541
Show us his face!

1553
02:08:25,021 --> 02:08:26,979
What the hell
is going on?

1554
02:08:28,317 --> 02:08:29,669
What is the delay?

1555
02:08:29,693 --> 02:08:31,400
Confirm the identity
of your agent!

1556
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:32,731
Yes!

1557
02:08:33,656 --> 02:08:34,737
That's our man!

1558
02:08:36,283 --> 02:08:37,944
She fucked them.

1559
02:08:38,119 --> 02:08:39,735
Goodbye, Nate.

1560
02:08:52,092 --> 02:08:53,457
Good morning.

1561
02:08:54,803 --> 02:08:56,419
Please, sit.

1562
02:08:56,596 --> 02:08:58,086
You were right
about your niece.

1563
02:08:58,181 --> 02:08:59,216
She did very well.

1564
02:08:59,391 --> 02:09:03,727
She called from Budapest.
Gave us the name of the mole.

1565
02:09:05,022 --> 02:09:06,353
Wonderful news.

1566
02:09:06,691 --> 02:09:09,058
I've had
a security detail

1567
02:09:09,152 --> 02:09:11,018
search the mole's office.

1568
02:09:11,195 --> 02:09:12,651
His apartment.

1569
02:09:14,449 --> 02:09:18,489
The apartment
was covered in metka.

1570
02:09:18,662 --> 02:09:20,619
Attributed to Nash.

1571
02:09:24,334 --> 02:09:26,826
This is a statement...

1572
02:09:27,004 --> 02:09:29,962
for an account opened
in a private bank in Vienna...

1573
02:09:30,132 --> 02:09:33,341
into which the Americans
have recently made payments...

1574
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:36,754
of $250,000.

1575
02:09:36,931 --> 02:09:39,172
Sort of money
paid to a defector.

1576
02:09:39,267 --> 02:09:42,055
The account is in your name
with your passport number.

1577
02:09:42,228 --> 02:09:44,310
Oh, I forgot my coat.
I'll get it.

1578
02:09:47,192 --> 02:09:50,025
You recently made a trip
to Vienna, did you not?

1579
02:09:50,195 --> 02:09:52,233
You know
this is my niece, right?

1580
02:09:52,323 --> 02:09:53,323
She's angry with me.

1581
02:09:53,491 --> 02:09:56,449
This is one of the disks
Boucher gave us.

1582
02:09:57,161 --> 02:09:59,823
The disks you passed on
to the president.

1583
02:09:59,914 --> 02:10:01,655
Your personal victory.

1584
02:10:03,042 --> 02:10:05,955
It's supposed to have
come from the DOD.

1585
02:10:06,128 --> 02:10:07,745
But at the request
of your niece,

1586
02:10:07,839 --> 02:10:10,627
we examined it
more closely.

1587
02:10:12,177 --> 02:10:14,509
The encryption signature
suggests

1588
02:10:14,596 --> 02:10:16,462
it was written in Langley.

1589
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:17,880
It's a fake.

1590
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:22,330
You are special.
You have a gift. Like me.

1591
02:10:22,354 --> 02:10:23,719
You see through people.

1592
02:10:23,813 --> 02:10:25,725
You see them
for what they really are.

1593
02:10:26,234 --> 02:10:28,942
And you always
stay one step ahead.

1594
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:33,904
Great family I have.

1595
02:10:47,839 --> 02:10:49,705
You killed me.

1596
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:52,416
Didn't I do well, Uncle?

1597
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,323
Target is in range.

1598
02:13:15,871 --> 02:13:17,032
Hello?

1599
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,286
Hello?
