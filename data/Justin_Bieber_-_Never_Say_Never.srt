00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,214
The rings, please?

3
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,483
Oh, God!

4
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,522
-No!
-Oh, my God!

5
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,928
You haven't made it
until you've played New York

6
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,192
and you've sold out the Garden.

7
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,638
He came from such a small town,
it gives us hope.

8
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,484
Madison Square Garden represents
the pinnacle of success.

9
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,047
Justin leans over and looks at me

10
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:43,957
and he said,
"I don't care how hard I have to work,

11
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,826
"or what we need to do,
I'm selling this place out in a year"

12
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,403
I love Justin Bieber!

13
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:40,067
I think about him, like, 99% of my life.

14
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:47,246
-His voice, his personality.
-His hair, his looks, everything.

15
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,615
No one used to know him a year ago,
and now everyone knows him.

16
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:56,854
He was born March 1st, 1994,
at 12:56 a.m. on a Tuesday.

17
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,387
One day, I tweeted him 100 times.

18
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:05,264
He is so much cooler than my brother!
So much!

19
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,968
Justin Bieber,

20
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,729
make sure you don't have
no more girlfriends,

21
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,395
'cause I'm your girlfriend.

22
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,932
He's just, like, a regular kid
who had a dream

23
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,475
and it just, like, came true.

24
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,577
I was young.

25
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:29,284
I wanted to make sure
that I gave him everything,

26
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,849
that I would be the best
that I could be for him.

27
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,890
It was hard work,

28
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,988
but it was worth it.

29
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,734
My parents helped a lot.

30
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:44,704
We're small-town people.
Even Toronto's too big for us.

31
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:50,473
His dad and I split
when he was about 10 months old.

32
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,907
I had a place of my own
and I lived with Justin.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,482
Just me and Justin.

34
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:59,041
I knew he needed stability in his life.

35
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,651
And God really gave me
a lot of strength.

36
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:05,951
We were pretty excited.
He was such a little sweetheart.

37
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,485
Justin and my dad were so close.

38
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,689
They just really bonded.

39
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,290
He was always with Justin, every day.

40
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,801
If he wasn't with him,
he'd be talking to him.

41
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,461
They were great like that.

42
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,972
I remember there's been days
when Justin would run away from school

43
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,404
because a teacher said something.

44
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,377
And instead of running home,
he ran over here, to Grandpa.

45
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,174
-Hi, Justin.
-Hi.

46
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:33,684
What are you going out to do?

47
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,344
Shovel.

48
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:36,819
Shovel what?

49
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,720
Snow.

50
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:41,350
And you're going to do the job, are you?

51
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,396
It was definitely challenging
to be a teenagen

52
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,026
and have to stay home
while all your friends are going out.

53
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:49,461
Justin! You're on my team...

54
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,697
I just knew that that's what I had to do.

55
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:55,536
If he didn't have sports,
I don't know what he would have done.

56
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,938
He would have drove us crazy.
He drove us crazy, anyway.

57
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,011
Okay, go for it, Justin.

58
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,679
Okay, once again, that's it.

59
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:13,019
Everybody's gonna be a hitter,
wait and see.

60
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:16,988
My son, Ryan, and Justin
have been friends since grade four.

61
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:20,828
He was a soccer coach for three, four
years, and Justin was always over here.

62
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:22,992
He would not release the ball.

63
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,961
He's the same with hockey,
he wouldn't pass the puck.

64
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:27,502
In soccer, he wouldn't pass the ball.

65
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:30,274
Me and him always used to sit
beside each other.

66
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,936
There's me, that's him, on the left.

67
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:36,611
Pass the ball. And when he did,
it worked out. It was great.

68
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,840
I had to stress to him

69
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,510
that making the goal
was as important as scoring the goal.

70
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,813
What is it?

71
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,290
Okay, now what do you do with it?

72
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,723
He never had any lessons or anything.

73
00:07:56,953 --> 00:08:01,771
I just never thought of it
being anything other than for fun.

74
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,332
I would have friends oven

75
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:07,606
and they would bring their guitars
and jam out at the house.

76
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:08,870
Justin, as a two-year-old,

77
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:12,347
he would wander up to the stairs,
right in front of the drum kit,

78
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,941
and just stare at Dan, the drummer
in the band at the time.

79
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,043
So how do you
usually count in your head?

80
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:19,646
One, two, three, four, five. One, two...

81
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,280
And he would just be mesmerized.

82
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,361
And he'd grab a pair of drumsticks
and he'd start hitting the stairs.

83
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,930
And everybody noticed
that his timing was amazing.

84
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,725
"Where does this talent come from?
Does he play drums?

85
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,863
"Man, you'd better get that kid a kit. "

86
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,407
There was a little plastic, miniature kit

87
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:44,481
and he got to bang on that
for two years.

88
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:48,178
And then he outgrew that kit.

89
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,351
Pattie's friends were musical
and they encouraged Justin.

90
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,855
And their church would have music in it.

91
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:01,890
They would be, you know, showing him
how to do a chord on the guitar

92
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:08,097
And then the boys at the church said
Justin had a musical talent.

93
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,199
And they had a benefit
down at one of the local hotels.

94
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,370
When we were preparing him
for his show,

95
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:17,376
he had to learn four jazz standards.

96
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:18,804
Come on up here, Justin.

97
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,281
Play a couple of songs
for the people here this evening.

98
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,113
And for an 8-year-old to play jazz,

99
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:26,121
it was quite difficult,
but he was up for it.

100
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,359
They made enough money that night
to buy Justin a big set of Pearl drums.

101
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:46,230
He'd go into the furnace room
and he would bang those drums

102
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:47,467
like you wouldn't believe.

103
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:50,044
And the worst part of it was,
he was good.

104
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,840
I love, like, pretty much everything
about him.

105
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:25,243
He's cute, he's awesome,
and we just love him so much.

106
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,181
Yeah, that's what I was just about
to say.

107
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,045
-We'll all be his wife, sooner or later.
-Yeah.

108
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:33,816
I'll be his first wife.
I'm his first wife, okay?

109
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:38,293
He's basically, like, giving back to us
because we love him so much.

110
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:41,727
-We do love him so much.
-Yeah, more than you could imagine.

111
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:44,823
I can't help it, I'm obsessed.
I love him. He's so cute.

112
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:47,333
I mean, I don't want him that way.
But he's just so cute.

113
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,895
He's really hot. He's adorable!

114
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:54,474
I remember my first concert
I went to with my mom, and so...

115
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,340
And it was your birthday present, yes.
We've been waiting for months for this.

116
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:00,210
-And what was your first concert?
-Michael Jackson, Thriller

117
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,337
When I was her age.

118
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,110
So I'm hoping she'll remember this one
for a long, long time.

119
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,746
-JB!
-JB!

120
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,259
Two, and three.

121
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,497
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

122
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:01,363
On three. One, two, three.

123
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,150
Justin?

124
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:26,992
I like this.
What do you think? You like it?

125
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,625
-I love it.
-I like it, too.

126
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,726
Put that hood under it, obviously.

127
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:34,567
It was his first show
and I went to his house to get him.

128
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:37,540
We were gonna go.
And he came up in this church suit.

129
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:40,408
Just like an Easter Sunday suit.

130
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:43,641
I was like, "Man, you don't have
to dress like that anymore."

131
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,181
-I like Bigger in the white jacket.
-Okay.

132
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,617
Purple. It just sort of looked cool.

133
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:51,087
They're gonna do a five-minute
on-the-fly thing with you.

134
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,624
They'll ask you questions while
you're standing and whatnot today.

135
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,723
Ryan's like the coolest
older brother ever.

136
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:59,025
Ryan's also like his jester
When Justin's down,

137
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,856
I'm like, "Ryan, go make him laugh."

138
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:05,134
Come on! Come on!

139
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:06,736
And Justin's cracking up.

140
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,299
Allison's the stern one.

141
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,197
I'm going to shave my head.

142
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,242
No, you are not!
Put that razor down right now!

143
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,539
-Say, "l love you, Justin."
-I love you, Justin. Put the razor back.

144
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,374
She's the one that handles business.

145
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,729
Carin works wardrobe with Ryan,
and she's like Justin 's big sister.

146
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:37,791
This is Justin's guitar.
it's a lefty. Justin's a southpaw.

147
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:42,638
Dan Kanter is Justin's musical director.
Super cool dude.

148
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,071
This is Scrappy.

149
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,042
Scrappy is the hardest working man
on the Justin Bieber tour,

150
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:48,202
maybe next to Justin.

151
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:51,881
Justin is a pleasure to work with,
most of the time.

152
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,751
I kind of look at him like a little brother.

153
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,390
That's twice!
You don't give me twice for that!

154
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,706
Kenny is technically
Justin 's security guard,

155
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:28,978
but Kenny's Justin's everything.

156
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:33,014
Kenny's with him 24/7.
He lives on the bus with him.

157
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:36,491
He has a definite trust with Kenny,
he feels like he can tell him anything.

158
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,925
It'll take two seconds.
I just want to drive it a little bit.

159
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,259
It's an uncle-nephew relationship.

160
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,562
In my phone,
I have him programmed in as "Nephew".

161
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,937
Kenny. What are you doing?

162
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,540
Scooter's kind of in the road family,
definitely Dad.

163
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,267
Justin, Justin, that's not funny.

164
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,504
-Turn it off. Not funny.
-It is funny.

165
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,548
You know, I think 90% of my job
is helping him become a good man.

166
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,547
It's a family.
So, we're supporting each other

167
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:02,207
and making sure the kid's okay.

168
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:18,967
Deeper. No, not like that.

169
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:21,391
There you go.

170
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:25,134
I'm a 54-year-old childless woman,
and they call me Mama.

171
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:30,073
Yo, I need a razor. Do you have one?

172
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,338
A razor? Really?

173
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,107
Here's something really cool
about vocal cords.

174
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,080
They can take my heart out of my chest
and put it in your body

175
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,240
and make that work.

176
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,282
Hey, don't cut your face, okay?

177
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:41,882
But they cannot replace
the human voice.

178
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,416
This entire tour hinges

179
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,657
on those two little strips of fiber
that sit in his neck.

180
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,161
While you're changing, do it, okay?

181
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,066
One of the hardest things, I think,
for a kid on the road to understand

182
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,797
is that he's a working man.

183
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,800
All right, I'm about to change my pants,
so you're gonna have to go.

184
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,212
Come on, come on, come on.

185
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:18,159
Don't waste it. Let's get you dressed.
Come on, let's go, it's walk time.

186
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,958
-Yo, all right.
-Yo, yo, it's walk time.

187
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,555
-This is Mama Jan.
-Hi, Mama.

188
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,430
-She's my vocal coach. This is my dad.
-My pleasure.

189
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,127
-Pleasure is mine.
-I think I saw you this afternoon.

190
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:29,567
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

191
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,697
Nice to meet you.

192
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,106
You ready to kill this, or what?

193
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,403
How's your voice?

194
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,141
Good. How is it?

195
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,401
It's getting there.

196
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,148
All right, we're going into focus mode.
Here we go.

197
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,009
I know you're prepared!

198
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,421
And you've been waiting
for this moment!

199
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:52,984
Everything you're feeling right now
is normal!

200
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,256
These people came to see you!

201
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,530
I'm here because you're here!
Let's rock! Let's rock!

202
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,300
All right, let's bring it in!
We're gonna say a prayer!

203
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,943
Thank you for the production crew,
all the staff, the players...

204
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,671
On the road, with a group of people,

205
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,476
it becomes
a very functional dysfunctional family,

206
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,482
all centered around one goal.

207
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,915
One more thing. I got to say something.

208
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:20,614
It's Jeremy's first show.
We got the grandparents.

209
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:21,984
We got a lot of stuff.

210
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,083
This one tonight
is a proud Canadian boy coming home

211
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,750
and representing for his nation.

212
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:33,234
Ducks, ducks, ducks, ducks!
Quack, quack, quack, quack! Zoom!

213
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,970
Sing it.

214
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,347
Make some noise
for Boyz II Men, everybody.

215
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,402
Sing it!

216
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,489
I can't hear you. Everybody!

217
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,887
All right.

218
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,817
Come on, sing it!

219
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,176
Sing it!

220
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:06,443
All right, Boyz II Men, sing it!

221
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,414
All right. One more time.

222
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:30,170
Your grandma's house is right here,
ain't it?

223
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,174
Yeah, this is it. Great.

224
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,815
Hey! Hi, Grandpa.

225
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,022
Look at my bed. This used to be huge.

226
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,793
Yeah, once upon a time,
it used to be huge for you.

227
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:03,301
-Good night.
-Good night, sweetheart.

228
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,348
What's up?

229
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:19,718
-I got my phone working.
-Nice.

230
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,348
Hey, buddy.

231
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,755
It went from, like,
hanging out every day almost

232
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:27,354
to only seeing each other
a couple of times a month, if that.

233
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:28,987
Who had the best shooting percentage
in that game?

234
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:31,362
I did. No backboard, please.

235
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,935
Now that we don't see each other
really anymore,

236
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,800
we just kind of, like, cherish the time
that we have together.

237
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,305
-You want to see something...
-Excuse me, sweetheart.

238
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,775
You can't go out
till you clean your room, okay?

239
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,175
-Can you go clean your room, please?
-Yes, I will.

240
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:44,439
-I've got to get your stuff on the bus.
-I will.

241
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:46,036
-All right, one second. One second.
-Thank you.

242
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:50,952
These are some animals
that my grandpa has collected.

243
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,648
And this is a wolf. This is a fox.

244
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:54,949
-They're roadkills, honey.
-And we...

245
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,425
Me and him were playing, like,
mini-sticks one day,

246
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,762
and I knocked off the leg, you know.

247
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:06,361
It wasn't very nice.
And then we tried to, like, tape it there.

248
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,871
And at one time, it just fell over,
and I blamed it on Chaz.

249
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:13,066
No, actually, we blamed it on Nolan.
And he wasn't even here.

250
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,232
That was fun.

251
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,798
All right, let's go.

252
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:17,742
I'm waiting for him to clean his room.

253
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:19,977
Seat belts, everyone.

254
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,717
Put your hands in the air!

255
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,140
Let's go to my old stomping grounds.

256
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:51,646
This is where we used to shoot ball
and work our abs.

257
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,287
First shot of the day.
Let's see how I am.

258
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,997
-Cut.
-You can edit that, right?

259
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:15,830
Yeah, edit that out.

260
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,840
I'm going to shoot this ball into that net,
all right?

261
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,036
That's how you do it.

262
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:39,648
Put your hands in the air! Go!

263
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,617
Hey, Ryan!

264
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:44,561
Hey, buddy!

265
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:48,233
Hey, buddy. How you doing, man?

266
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:49,734
How's work?
I'm just gonna come in to work with you.

267
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:26,960
Hey, yo, Sean! Sean, what's up, man?

268
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,804
He was in town,
and he stopped by the school.

269
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:34,471
As a matter of fact,
he did autograph his locker,

270
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:36,172
but our cleaning staff is very diligent

271
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,843
and they thought it was graffiti
and they washed it off.

272
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:46,847
Sing it!

273
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:50,883
I can't hear you!

274
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,589
I think we got to turn up the music
for all you people!

275
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:14,474
You want to say grace?

276
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,416
Thank you, Lord, for this pizza,

277
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:20,083
this cheese,
pineapple, bacon, pepperoni.

278
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,717
-And thank you to Hawaiian people...
-People.

279
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,260
-...for making our pizza.
-For making... Yeah.

280
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,389
Thank you. Thank you, Lord. No.
Thank you that we have great friends.

281
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,025
We are able to hang out together
and have a good time.

282
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:31,654
-Amen.
-Amen.

283
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:47,248
-Hello.
-Hi.

284
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,012
-How are you?
-Are you Justin Bieber?

285
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:52,717
-Yes, I am. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

286
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:53,847
I used to sit right here.

287
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,361
I used to sit on those steps
and I used to play here, too.

288
00:25:57,414 --> 00:26:00,260
-So keep playing.
-Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:02,195
And always follow your dreams, okay?

290
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:03,321
-Okay.
-All right.

291
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,334
Thank you very much. Have a good day.

292
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:12,434
He was about 12 years old

293
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:16,606
when he wanted to go
and play in front of the Avon Theater.

294
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:29,023
Those apartments
across the road there,

295
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:31,391
their windows would be all closed
in the summertime.

296
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:32,927
But the minute they heard him sing,

297
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,863
they would just all open up
and just let his voice right in.

298
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,637
-He is amazing.
-Yeah. This kid is about to be famous.

299
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,599
His voice carried all over this area.

300
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:01,855
All right, take it away.

301
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,083
Hey, everybody.

302
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:10,162
I was like, "You're only 12 years old.
You've never had any singing lessons.

303
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:12,758
"So if you don't make it, it's okay."

304
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:18,172
He asked me to come
to his Stratford Idol Competition.

305
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:19,297
So I went and saw that.

306
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:24,605
I was definitely worried
that he could beat me.

307
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,150
He was singing all styles of music.

308
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,314
R&B, he was rapping some,

309
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:37,690
and he would have little dances
made up for them, break dancing and...

310
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:50,641
That natural instinct was in Justin,
to respond to little mistakes like that.

311
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,605
He made it
an entertainment opportunity.

312
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:56,974
I was like,
"Whoa, where'd this come from, man?"

313
00:27:57,832 --> 00:28:00,144
Our next Stratford Star winner.

314
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:07,378
Even though he got second,
he still got the attention he needed.

315
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,153
People recognize my face
from the videos,

316
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:13,926
just knowing that I'm the girl
who beat Justin Bieber.

317
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:21,728
We have family that live in
different provinces that wanted to come.

318
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:25,763
At this time, he was playing around
on YouTube and he'd seen some stuff.

319
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:28,366
So he said, "Why don't we just put it up
on there and send her the link?"

320
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:32,941
The next thing you know,
we had hits from strangers

321
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,505
just requesting other songs.

322
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:36,571
I was like, "This is fun.

323
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,709
"They want you to post another video.
Let's do this one."

324
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,517
And I was like,
"You got 100,000 subscribers.

325
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:46,082
"Where'd that come from?"
He's like, "People like my stuff."

326
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:55,301
I'd just come back
from a night out with friends.

327
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:57,789
Went online
and I saw this little 12-year-old

328
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,672
singing Aretha Franklin, Respect,
and thought, "That's pretty good."

329
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,967
And there was another one.
There were about six videos.

330
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,135
So I click on another one.

331
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:06,568
Click on another one.

332
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,081
And then I clicked on him
singing Ne-Yo, So Sick.

333
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:25,096
That's when I got the buzz.

334
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,633
I actually canceled all my meetings
the next day,

335
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:30,603
and said, ”i'm gonna find this kid today. ”
I kind of became obsessed with him-

336
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:36,008
I remember getting a message
on YouTube.

337
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:40,445
I had a call from my friend saying,
"There's this guy named Scooter Braun

338
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:42,104
"trying to reach you."

339
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:46,176
He got a hold of Justin's great-aunt,
got a hold of the school board.

340
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:48,254
He contacted the Avon Theater.

341
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:50,920
I was like, "Who is this guy?"

342
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,547
I just went to a computer phone

343
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:53,956
and called him
from an unknown number

344
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,789
just to say, "Please, stop calling."

345
00:29:55,981 --> 00:30:00,162
"Hi, it's Pattie Mallette.
You were calling about my son, Justin?"

346
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:03,529
You know, she thought she was gonna
have a phone call to get rid of me.

347
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:07,540
And we ended up talking
for about two to three hours.

348
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:11,339
He said, "Come to Atlanta for a week,
no strings attached,

349
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:12,899
"and I'll just introduce you
to a bunch of people,

350
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:14,377
"let you know I'm for real.

351
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,948
"And if you don't like it,
you don't want to sign with us,

352
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:21,271
"you get a free vacation out of it,
and, you know, back to life as usual."

353
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:54,879
So, I pick Justin up from the airport,
and I had a purple Mercedes with rims.

354
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,751
Justin saw it, his eyes got real big
and he's like, "Sweet car."

355
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:26,848
I told Justin,
"Do you want to meet Jermaine Dupri?"

356
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:29,614
And he goes,
"The guy who does Grillz with Nelly?"

357
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:35,682
We pull up to the studio
and we all get out,

358
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:38,490
and as we're about to walk in
this Range Rover pulls up,

359
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:39,687
and Usher gets out.

360
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:45,830
And Justin,
he really, really looked up to Usher

361
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,163
I'm like, "Justin, don't say a word."

362
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,846
Justin just freaks out. "Oh, my God,
is that Usher? Is that Usher?"

363
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:04,510
He's, like, losing his mind.

364
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:05,918
And he goes running right up to Usher
and he goes,

365
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,891
"Man, I'm one of your biggest fans.
Can I sing one of your songs to you?"

366
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,688
And I look at this kid like,

367
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:13,457
"l just picked you up.
I just told you not to do this."

368
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,869
Usher looks at him and he thought
he was, like, my little cousin.

369
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,170
He goes, "it's cold outside, buddy.
Don't worry about it."

370
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,606
He pushes him aside,
and Usher goes into the studio

371
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,901
and he starts his session.

372
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:29,912
And I look at Justin, I was like,
"l just told you not to sing for anybody."

373
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,412
And he goes,
"You said not to sing for Jermaine.

374
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,503
"You didn't say anything about Usher."

375
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:44,961
At the time, Scooter didn't have
a whole lot of experience.

376
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:49,933
But he was so confident in Justin,
we started making plans to go forward.

377
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:55,635
I kept flying him back and forth.
We were doing all these meetings.

378
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,000
And everyone started saying no.

379
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,934
Every label said,
"There's no platform for him."

380
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,246
"You need Nickelodeon or Disney.
You need the machine."

381
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,108
Do you guys read the stats

382
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,208
that kids are spending
more time on the Internet

383
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:12,843
than they are watching TV?

384
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:19,588
And the place where they're watching
most of their videos is You Tube.

385
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:22,658
It was the most frustrating thing
in the entire world.

386
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,366
I started thinking,
who would be the perfect person?

387
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,576
You're gonna sing with me or what?

388
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,194
Okay, then. All right.

389
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,663
-Your friends will believe you now.
-Yeah.

390
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,474
I said, "This is like a no-brainer."

391
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,208
So now Usher is shocked.

392
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:20,754
And he looks at me and he goes,
"Who is this kid?"

393
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:24,615
And Justin kind of has
a smile on his face.

394
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:25,919
"You don't remember me?
You blew me off

395
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,551
"outside of Jermaine Dupri's studio."

396
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:30,223
And Usher was like, "Okay."

397
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,229
I said, "l really feel like
you have something incredible.

398
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,392
"But I think that
we should take it to L.A. Reid."

399
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:38,494
Justin was excited 'cause he knew
this was the guy who had signed

400
00:34:38,558 --> 00:34:41,599
Pink, Avril Lavigne, Outkast, Usher
and so many others.

401
00:34:41,694 --> 00:34:43,039
And he said, "Yeah, at the Grammys,

402
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:45,271
"I've heard people thank him
many times. "

403
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,119
My first impression was,
"Wow, the Macaulay Culkin of music."

404
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,654
That was the first thing
I thought in my head.

405
00:34:57,777 --> 00:35:00,954
He came in and he soaked up
all the air in the room.

406
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,519
And he sang really well.

407
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,127
But it wasn't even that.

408
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,694
It was the face.

409
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:15,536
It was the hair. He was brave-

410
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:17,906
When it was all said and done,
I was beyond convinced

411
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:20,742
that Usher had
absolutely delivered a gift.

412
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,014
He was in grade eight,
it was about halfway through the year

413
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:33,049
He came and he said,
"Mrs. Booker, I'm talking with Usher."

414
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:36,387
And I said, "Great
But I really don't know who Usher is."

415
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:37,754
We're going to pull Justin.

416
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:40,425
Justin didn't know this.
But, Justin, you were in the studio.

417
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:43,560
Come on over here. He's a good-looking
14-year-old young man.

418
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:45,661
-Have a seat right next to your mom.
-Hey, honey.

419
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,500
And he sounds even better
than he looks.

420
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:49,574
-He does.
-What a voice.

421
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:52,338
Pattie, tell us a bit about
what's happening now in Justin's life.

422
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:53,433
This is hot off the presses.

423
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,876
We just signed with a music label

424
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:57,779
and we're moving in
about a week to the US.

425
00:35:57,836 --> 00:36:03,485
So it's a big step, and he's got
a long journey and great plans.

426
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,615
Congratulations, Justin and Pattie.

427
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,894
They were excited to go.
We were a little leery at them going,

428
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:18,232
but we were excited for them to go, too.

429
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:21,869
I mean, once they walked through
that gate at the airport, it's...

430
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,839
That's the end of it. They're gone.

431
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:32,376
There are moments
that you come across all your life.

432
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:36,115
There's always that moment
when you have to let go.

433
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,178
And that was one of them.

434
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,631
I moved him down to Atlanta
on my own dime.

435
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:56,938
ATL, shawty!

436
00:36:56,993 --> 00:37:00,102
It was summertime.
He wasn't going to school.

437
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,437
He didn't have any friends.

438
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:04,971
I called the label and said,
"Let's make some moves."

439
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,377
And they were mad at me.

440
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:10,610
"What do you mean, you spent money?
We're not ready. "

441
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:11,710
Done.

442
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:15,123
If it was up to them, we'd have come out
with Justin when he was 28 years old.

443
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:18,223
I can grow facial hair really easily.

444
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:22,328
I was coming in to help them
get acclimated to being in Atlanta.

445
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,333
Look, I grew a mustache.

446
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:25,993
I remember he used to ask me,

447
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:28,800
"When am I gonna get in the studio?
We're just sitting around."

448
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:30,840
Justin was looking at me,
"When are we gonna do something?"

449
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,967
I was like, "That's it. I'm with the kid."

450
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:44,819
That's when they called me in.

451
00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:48,826
In addition to singing, Justin also plays
drums, guitar keyboards and trumpet.

452
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,292
He's currently being managed by
Usher and Scooter Braun.

453
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:53,693
I met Justin in December 2008.

454
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,634
Scooter and Usher both know me and
they decided that it was a good thing

455
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:01,365
to bring Justin in to work with me
ahead of time, prior to the recording,

456
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:03,872
just to get some basics underneath him.

457
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:07,604
Tonight he'll be singing an original tune
entitled Common Denominator.

458
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,201
Here 's Justin Bieber.

459
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,680
I'm not five years old.

460
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:23,982
They started a bit too early.

461
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,494
Can you start it oven please?

462
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:53,915
So, we started.
We started cutting records in Atlanta.

463
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:58,327
We started working with different
people and trying different things.

464
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,329
I didn't mean to stop you like that,
but this is only a tease.

465
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,407
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing to you,

466
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:15,169
Island Def Jam recording artist,

467
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,370
Justin Bieber's
getting ready to go down.

468
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,641
Just so you know, we're in the studio
right now working on it.

469
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,044
Get ready because it's gonna be big.

470
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:22,309
-Ain't that right, Justin?
-That's right.

471
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,136
That's right. So, look out, we're coming.

472
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,912
Doing it once again, now.

473
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:33,830
Check it. We gonna do it like,
when I say, "Justin", y'all say "Bieber!"

474
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,327
-Justin!
-Bieber!

475
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,920
-Justin!
-Bieber!

476
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:40,230
When I say, "One", y'all say, ”Time!”

477
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:41,768
-One!
-Time!

478
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:43,461
-One!
-Time!

479
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:59,438
I said, "That song, One Time,
that should be the first single.

480
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,707
"'Cause I think it's up-tempo,
it'll get the kids excited."

481
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:09,012
June 2009,

482
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:13,049
Justin was playing at a water park in
Poughkeepsie, New York, for 40 people.

483
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:18,486
It was raining at the water park,
by the way. Pouring rain.

484
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,766
Antonio was dancing-
Marvin was dancing-

485
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,200
Tay was deejaying.
Dan was playing guitar.

486
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,532
And me and Ryan.

487
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,799
I mean, it went naturally.

488
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,301
But naturally doesn't mean easy.

489
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,878
There's work that goes into that.
And you have to do the footwork.

490
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:42,052
"In radio, we don't play a young kid.

491
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:45,147
"Fifteen years old,
he's got a young voice.

492
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,554
"That's not our thing. "

493
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:48,747
Everybody, come on.

494
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,224
They didn't understand it.

495
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:55,864
Hand-to-hand combat is what we did.
We put Justin in a van and on airplanes.

496
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,232
And that kid, planes, trains
and automobiles.

497
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,999
-Q102, live in the studio, Justin Bieber
-What's up, guys?

498
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:02,093
AH the hits-

499
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:04,232
Is this being played
anywhere else in the country right now?

500
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:05,707
Justin, what are you going to
sing for us right now?

501
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:12,007
I'm gonna sing One Time acoustically.
You guys have heard of the track?

502
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:14,207
One Time. it's an acoustic version.

503
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:29,355
He went to every single one.

504
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,865
If you weren't playing his record,

505
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:31,923
he still went.

506
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:39,809
And he'd play his guitar for you acoustic
and he'd sing, on the spot, any request.

507
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,401
And he won people over.

508
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:49,280
-Wow.
-That was nice, man.

509
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:52,687
-Justin Bieber, do not forget us, bro!
-I won't.

510
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:55,659
There's not a deejay that can say
they have not met Justin Bieber.

511
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:01,831
Waking up early, going to radio stations,
meeting with...

512
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,800
You know, it's just adults.

513
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:05,834
Everything is just adults.

514
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,369
I'm so excited to go to Hartford.

515
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,038
He started twittering.

516
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:13,837
"I'm gonna be at this radio station.
I'm gonna be at this radio station."

517
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:20,180
First 20 kids, then 40 kids,
then 100 kids.

518
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:23,652
Then a couple of hundred kids started
lining up outside of these radio stations

519
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:25,244
to just get a glimpse of him.

520
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,784
And they started to play his record.

521
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:37,660
Justin, Justin, Justin!

522
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:42,706
Chaos at Roosevelt Field Mall today.
The crowd was so huge

523
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:45,274
local police are on hand
trying to control this crowd.

524
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,907
I think at that point no one realized how
powerful social networking was or is.

525
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,303
Oh, my God!

526
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:07,925
Who caused this? Justin Bieber?
That kid with the hair and that can sing?

527
00:44:08,283 --> 00:44:10,629
He caused this whole huge thing?

528
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:14,603
Justin's fans are the most
loyal group of girls on the planet.

529
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:16,831
They all feel a certain ownership
over him

530
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:19,499
because they feel like they found him
before Scooter found him,

531
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:22,670
before the record labels found him.
He belongs to them.

532
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:26,410
They're there for him.
God, I've never seen fans like this.

533
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,465
What is it you guys love so much
about Justin Bieber?

534
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,098
I like his songs.

535
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:30,738
I like his songs.

536
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,406
I like how he looks.

537
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:35,871
-His eyes. They're so cute.
-Just...

538
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:38,178
And his little smile and his laugh.

539
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:39,478
His laugh is so cute.

540
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,643
-His laugh?
-We're obsessed with that.

541
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,883
-What's it like?
-He's like... That's so cute.

542
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:46,083
I like the way how he smiles.

543
00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:49,362
His hair, I love his hair.
Flip, like, every five minutes.

544
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,397
Yeah, I love his hair.

545
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,252
The hair, it's perfect.

546
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:46,983
I could rock his hairdo, but I want to see
him rock some of these one time

547
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:49,111
so he could step his game up.
So, Justin,

548
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,712
get you some pigtails, man,

549
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,824
you know what I'm talking about,
with accessories on the ends

550
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:57,797
so the girls can play with your hair, man.
That's another tool you'll be able to use.

551
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:02,932
-Do not eat that.
-I put them there! See?

552
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,536
-That's disgusting!
-You are a gross monkey.

553
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,928
That is the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

554
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,261
I put them there.

555
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,605
It doesn't matter
who put them in the garbage.

556
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,405
They were still in the garbage.

557
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,706
So, we got the stuff,
we gotta get it out of here now

558
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:16,872
'cause the cops are going to
sneak him out.

559
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,717
In our business, what happened
with Justin Bieber

560
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,917
has never happened before.
Truly a phenomenon.

561
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,688
Even groups like NSYNC
and the Backstreet Boys took years.

562
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:35,497
But already over a million copies have
been ordered in the United States alone.

563
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,967
I was honestly blown away by his talent.

564
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:41,768
It's called My World 2.0 and it's
the number one album in the country.

565
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,634
You guys know Justin Bieber?

566
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,713
Justin is now in that
rarefied atmosphere-

567
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,647
All these giant artists
who sell out arenas

568
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,981
every two or three years
when they go on tour,

569
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,577
well, Justin's one of them now.

570
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,380
He's become a member of that club.

571
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:02,153
I mean, look at him.
He's like a dreamy Christmas elf

572
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,354
On his first record,
in his first year and a half,

573
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,068
I don't believe
that's ever happened before.

574
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,465
Justin!

575
00:48:20,997 --> 00:48:25,417
I want to marry Justin Bieber.
We will be husband and wife.

576
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:31,483
Bieber Fever. It is a pandemic-

577
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,050
Thousands of screaming teens!

578
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:34,647
Around the world, girls are losing it.

579
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,921
In Sydney, scenes that weren't
that far off Beatlemania.

580
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,186
...Justin and Justin...

581
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:41,263
Justin Bieber's visit to town
is actually good news.

582
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,770
Police have called off the event
because of safety concerns.

583
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,427
Bieber is in town.

584
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,803
It's a hysteria
that I've never witnessed before.

585
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,501
This is what happened with
The Beatles and The Monkees.

586
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:26,997
The ultimate in our business
is becoming an arena headliner,

587
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:29,970
being able to sell out
Madison Square Garden.

588
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:34,978
Madison Square Garden represents
the pinnacle of success for an artist.

589
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:38,305
The Rolling Stones. U2.

590
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:41,144
Michael Jackson. This is the big time.

591
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:47,981
And for this kid
to play Madison Square Garden

592
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:50,388
and he's the headliner?

593
00:50:50,477 --> 00:50:52,891
Give me a break. Come on.
This just doesn't happen.

594
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,657
Come on! Say, yeah!

595
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:11,697
JB, you are. Yeah, man.

596
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,712
-All right! Hey! Hey!
-Hey!

597
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:23,943
Stop the movie! You, down there!

598
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:26,042
-Texting? Texting!
-Stop texting.

599
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,577
Sleeping? Making out back there? Hey!

600
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:30,950
-Enough!
-Enough is enough.

601
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:32,318
-Cut that!
-Cut it.

602
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:34,578
-Bring it back.
-Let's go!

603
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,955
Do you guys have tickets to the show?

604
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:40,692
-You don't have any tickets?
-We don't.

605
00:52:40,752 --> 00:52:43,531
-Are you big fans?
-This girl is obsessed.

606
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:46,731
-This is all she does, is Justin Bieber.
-Really?

607
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:49,330
-What's your favorite song?
-Sing it.

608
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:52,504
Yeah, sing.

609
00:53:03,107 --> 00:53:04,952
We usually have 10, 20 tickets left.

610
00:53:05,043 --> 00:53:08,995
And we go out, we talk to kids,
talk to families and hear their stories.

611
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,132
It's like me and the guy
from Extreme Home Makeover

612
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:16,962
have the best jobs in the world.

613
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:20,164
'Cause we get paid
to just make other people happy.

614
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:46,761
You guys going to the concert?

615
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:48,890
You guys have tickets to the show?
Everybody's got tickets?

616
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:52,163
We give them free tickets,
and they're usually in the first 10 rows.

617
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:54,704
The best price.
Nobody can beat my prices.

618
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:57,036
I'm the corny one.
I call it, like, "We got to give back."

619
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:03,409
Section 108, Row 8.

620
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:06,179
You're choking me!

621
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:07,739
Thank you.

622
00:54:07,804 --> 00:54:10,686
If it wasn't for these kids out there
camping out and doing what they do,

623
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,779
we don't have jobs.

624
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:14,083
-Oh, great!
-They're real close.

625
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:15,657
-Give her a hug!
-Thank you.

626
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:18,958
Thank you so much. You don't even
know how much I appreciate this.

627
00:54:23,753 --> 00:54:26,965
I just happen to have some tickets
in my pocket.

628
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,277
-We can't get in.
-What if I gave you tickets?

629
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:43,081
Oh, my God,
do you want me to drop dead?

630
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:45,485
Here. Row 7. You're really close.

631
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,581
This is so awesome!
Oh, my God, Pattie.

632
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,756
You're in the second row.

633
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,163
Do you cry when you see him?

634
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:59,167
We cried when we saw you.

635
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,903
It's actually the most gratifying thing
about the job.

636
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,479
Little things go a very, very long way.

637
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:18,711
The moment we forget that,
I think it's oven

638
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:29,828
The fact Justin can do that for families
is crazy.

639
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:35,233
This is the best thing
that happened in my life!

640
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:36,496
Oh, my God.

641
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:04,287
Do you want to be
the One Less Lonely Girl?

642
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:07,156
-Yes!
-Okay, come on.

643
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:11,461
The One Less Lonely Girl has become
a tradition of our show,

644
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:14,364
where we randomly pull a girl
out of the audience.

645
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,265
Come with me.

646
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:21,070
Every show, we pick a new girl
and bring her onstage.

647
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,698
Justin serenades hen

648
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:25,210
gives her some flowers
and makes her feel special.

649
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:26,760
Was he as cute as you thought
he was gonna be in person?

650
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,821
So hot.

651
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,593
I love him so much!

652
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:53,647
One, two, three, four, five and six
and seven and eight.

653
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:54,780
Let's try it again.

654
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:56,757
-Everything looks cooler.
-Everything is cooler.

655
00:59:56,812 --> 01:00:00,696
This is like in Super Mario Brothers
when you became Big Mario.

656
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:03,696
-Are you too young or you know that?
-No, I know that.

657
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:06,464
It's when you eat the mushroom
and it goes...

658
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,874
So coming up, Madison Square Garden,
the biggest show of Justin's career.

659
01:00:11,927 --> 01:00:14,672
We've made some changes
for the Garden show.

660
01:00:14,764 --> 01:00:16,439
Much bigger screen.

661
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:20,450
We have some extra screens coming in.
We finally have some explosions,

662
01:00:20,503 --> 01:00:22,781
so I can't wait to see what that's like.

663
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:24,678
Big boy!

664
01:00:25,107 --> 01:00:27,521
-I'm ready. This is gonna be sick.
-Yeah.

665
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:29,353
-I like your mic.
-Thank you.

666
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:30,756
-Is this yours?
-Yeah.

667
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:35,323
-Your hair's so big.
-I know.

668
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:49,206
Jaden's here because he's coming
to perform Never Say Never

669
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:51,371
at Madison Square Garden.

670
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:54,746
It's going to be
his first performance, ever.

671
01:00:56,805 --> 01:00:59,721
When your dad is Will Smith
and your mom is Jada Pinkett-Smith,

672
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:03,453
I think you have some performance
and stuff in your blood.

673
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:06,186
Jaden's watching tonight.

674
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,528
-I don't understand. Why?
-Why is he watching?

675
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:13,034
'Cause he wants to see everything
so he can learn it.

676
01:01:14,523 --> 01:01:16,333
-You think he should do it tonight?
-Of course.

677
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:21,008
You doing it tonight.
Get it out of the way.

678
01:01:21,062 --> 01:01:24,308
-Your parents will have a heart attack.
-Why?

679
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:27,872
Everyone wants to come up
for his first performance.

680
01:01:27,969 --> 01:01:28,971
We got to tell them.

681
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:32,178
But in a way, you know what,
"We're just feeling it. We're doing it."

682
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,344
"They made me."

683
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:34,979
-"They made me."
-"They made me do it."

684
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:37,058
"They made me do it. I didn't wanna."

685
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:40,160
-You want to do it tonight?
-Yeah.

686
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,024
My parents
are taking a helicopter out here.

687
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:45,761
-Are they really?
-Yeah, they weren't going to miss this.

688
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,235
I can't believe it.

689
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,826
They're probably in the air right now.

690
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,102
I just told them not to come,
but that didn't work out.

691
01:01:56,697 --> 01:01:58,041
Coming in right now.

692
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,079
Justin is in a bus and he's not moving.

693
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,411
I think he's dehydrated
from being in the sun all day yesterday.

694
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,382
Did Mama Jan go there and look at him?

695
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:05,941
She's, like, going in there now.

696
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,850
What do you think is going on

697
01:02:07,908 --> 01:02:10,117
in terms of keeping your voice
where you should and not wasting it?

698
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:14,995
I guess, like, I was at home
for a few days, so I was talking.

699
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:16,687
But I wasn't screaming.

700
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,287
Hey, Ryan!

701
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:20,927
That's how we do it!

702
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,368
You have so much demand
on your voice already.

703
01:02:23,423 --> 01:02:25,905
Eighty-six shows
is a whole lot of stuff to have to do,

704
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,373
on anybody's voice.
We're not talking about just you.

705
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:32,413
You really have to be more cautious
when you do have downtime.

706
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,477
Do the best job you can do, okay?
Have a good show.

707
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:38,449
I'm gonna rock this show.

708
01:04:43,026 --> 01:04:46,910
Justin 's 16.
He's just fighting to be a normal kid.

709
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:52,176
I remember being at the VMAs
and Madonna came out

710
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:53,841
to give a speech
about Michael Jackson.

711
01:04:53,938 --> 01:04:55,577
And she said
we took away his childhood.

712
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:58,213
And Justin looks right at me.
He goes, "Don't let that happen to me."

713
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:05,386
Being a 16-year-old, there's a certain
amount of fear and nervousness

714
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:08,159
with all the stuff that he's dealing with.

715
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,327
He says he's not nervous,
but when he's nervous

716
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:15,363
he goes through dance steps.
He does popping and everything.

717
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:16,530
Okay?

718
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:19,873
All right.
Let me just have a minute alone, guys.

719
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:23,576
There's not really a whole lot of
training schools for how to handle this.

720
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:27,379
Sometimes he'll get a little whiny
about having a normal life,

721
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:29,475
and I'll say, "You know what?
You gave up normal.

722
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:30,873
"This is your new normal."

723
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:33,219
All right, let's roll.

724
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:35,258
I have a lot in common with Justin.

725
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:38,494
We are really lucky to have gotten
this opportunity so young

726
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:40,654
and to relate to younger fans.

727
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:43,461
But also, the thing is
we both worked really hard.

728
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,968
Doing tours, even when you're tired
or when you feel sick,

729
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:48,264
and always having
that smile on your face,

730
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:50,431
it wasn't always easy.

731
01:05:58,934 --> 01:06:01,417
Hello, everybody!
How you guys doing tonight?

732
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,484
Give it up for Miley Cyrus, everybody!

733
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,836
-What?
-You tell me on a scale of one to 10.

734
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,872
Seven.

735
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:15,770
Minus three?

736
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:18,709
It was not a four.

737
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:22,476
Justin needs rest.
That's really our best friend at this point.

738
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:25,049
My voice sounded good
on a couple of them.

739
01:09:25,103 --> 01:09:26,607
Hear how your voice sounds now?

740
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:28,516
He's giving it everything he's got.

741
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:34,655
But doing 86 shows for any vocalist
is a lot to ask.

742
01:09:46,624 --> 01:09:50,576
-Justin! Justin! Justin!
-Justin! Justin! Justin!

743
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:57,542
How is everyone doing?

744
01:10:02,706 --> 01:10:05,349
Does anyone have any questions
or anything they wanna ask?

745
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:06,916
Yes?

746
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,293
I'm feeling all right.
Probably like a four out of 10.

747
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,197
Your hair's all back now.

748
01:10:19,323 --> 01:10:20,599
You know. You know.

749
01:10:20,658 --> 01:10:23,835
Yesterday, he had an Afro.
It was, like, this big.

750
01:10:23,894 --> 01:10:26,571
The vocal rest really is the most
important thing for Justin right now

751
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,110
because his voice is fatigued.

752
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:31,047
The bigger part is he's 16 years old
and doesn't know when to shut up.

753
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:33,416
All right, let's take a look.

754
01:10:34,137 --> 01:10:36,585
-Hi, girls.
-What are you guys doing?

755
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:38,587
We're waiting for Justin Bieber.

756
01:10:38,641 --> 01:10:41,284
Justin Bieber's sick.
He's seeing a specialist.

757
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:42,653
-Are you crying?
-Yeah.

758
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:45,195
No, don't cry. Don't worry about it.

759
01:10:45,248 --> 01:10:47,491
I was able to see that his vocal cords
are swollen.

760
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,331
There's a lot of mucus, a lot of junk
and debris all over his throat.

761
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:54,200
Here's perfect timing. Come here.
This is our agent.

762
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,102
-He just walked up.
-How do you do?

763
01:10:56,193 --> 01:10:58,573
-This is the doctor.
-I'm glad you're here.

764
01:10:58,661 --> 01:11:01,645
His throat's really infected, so
he really needs to take some time off.

765
01:11:01,698 --> 01:11:05,080
When Justin has days off is usually
when he comes back his hoarsest.

766
01:11:05,134 --> 01:11:07,481
-Yeah, he's got to learn.
-He screams and yells.

767
01:11:07,537 --> 01:11:10,179
We want him to be
a healthy 16-year-old,

768
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,882
but if he's taking on this career
as a commitment,

769
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,149
it comes with obligations.

770
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,490
And there's a professionalism
that comes along with it at any age,

771
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:19,825
where you have to
make certain sacrifices.

772
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:22,957
And that's why I think
he has to cancel tomorrow's event.

773
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:26,801
Syracuse is out of the question. No way.

774
01:11:29,325 --> 01:11:32,639
We're telling you we'd like to
postpone till the first, correct.

775
01:11:32,728 --> 01:11:35,337
It's the best thing we can do. I know
you don't want to cancel on anybody.

776
01:11:35,397 --> 01:11:37,003
-I don't.
-I know,

777
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:40,175
but this is where we are. We have to
do this. Otherwise, you could...

778
01:11:40,236 --> 01:11:43,413
If I say, "Justin, it's your choice, we can
do Syracuse tomorrow," you'll say "Yes,"

779
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:46,149
'cause you want to do every show.
But you'll destroy your vocal cords

780
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:48,350
-and we can't risk that.
-I would not let you do that.

781
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:51,018
I already have stepped in,
but I would not let you do that.

782
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:53,722
There's gonna be a lot of kids
that are going to be let down.

783
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,558
Can I tell you something?

784
01:11:56,618 --> 01:11:59,100
Hear me clearly on this

785
01:11:59,187 --> 01:12:02,262
that you do this now
and move one or two,

786
01:12:02,357 --> 01:12:05,865
or we're going to be shutting down
five, six, maybe seven later.

787
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,911
Do you want to cancel seven shows
or move one or two now?

788
01:12:08,964 --> 01:12:11,412
-Move one.
-Okay, we're gonna move one now.

789
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:15,851
And, that's the option you have tonight.
You may not have this option

790
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:18,888
if you don't make smart decisions
about this in a week or two.

791
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,215
That's where we are.

792
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:21,346
We've never canceled a show.

793
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:23,482
We've done over 120 shows
in the last two years.

794
01:12:23,544 --> 01:12:27,121
We did 14 shows with a broken foot.
Sang through strep throat.

795
01:12:27,182 --> 01:12:29,061
We're three days
from the biggest show of our tour.

796
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:30,991
The timing could not be worse.

797
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:36,833
-Can you give me an E?
-How about McDonald's tonight?

798
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:39,975
-No. Give me an E.
-Chicken nuggets?

799
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,064
Fried stuff, the doctor said
you're not supposed to have.

800
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:43,371
Those are fried.

801
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:46,347
But he also said, "No one's perfect."

802
01:12:46,401 --> 01:12:50,113
And he said, if you do it,
"You're a kid and you can do it."

803
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,311
I'll tell you what,
I'm only trying to help you here.

804
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:54,651
Is this what you want to do?

805
01:12:57,177 --> 01:12:58,418
You still in the game?

806
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,927
Or you ready to can it
and go home to Canada?

807
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:02,964
Nope? You're still
in the game then, right?

808
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:05,554
Okay.

809
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:09,833
People don't often understand if
a singer says, "My voice is going down."

810
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:13,465
They understand if
a football player tears a muscle,

811
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:17,001
but the same thing, really,
can happen to a singer's throat.

812
01:13:17,097 --> 01:13:20,047
This is the strictest vocal rest
he is going to know.

813
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,646
And now, the protocol has to be
carried out by all of us,

814
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:27,053
and it's not just about the next 36 hours,
this is ongoing for the rest of this tour.

815
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,588
-Why don't you go talk to him?
-I'm happy to.

816
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:36,621
You and I'll talk about your regiment.
This is fine. You can do this all day.

817
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:40,533
I love you for doing that, okay.
You just can't talk on it.

818
01:14:25,398 --> 01:14:28,382
Hello, sweetheart. Don't talk.

819
01:14:30,268 --> 01:14:31,943
How's my baby?

820
01:14:33,472 --> 01:14:35,475
Do you not feel good?

821
01:14:36,241 --> 01:14:39,555
Okay, I got Justin on board
and we're leaving right now.

822
01:14:41,747 --> 01:14:44,697
It's been a rough week.
We're on our way straight to the doctor,

823
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:48,732
and we got to see if
the swelling in his throat went down.

824
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:52,261
I think we're all a little bit on edge
to make sure he's healthy enough.

825
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:57,234
God, I pray that you will just
help Justin's headache go away.

826
01:14:57,963 --> 01:15:00,445
And I pray for complete healing.

827
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,946
New York City.

828
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,588
Okay, let's see what's going on.

829
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,554
Say "Ah".

830
01:15:14,979 --> 01:15:16,324
It's still red in the throat.

831
01:15:17,549 --> 01:15:18,790
-I hate this.
-I know.

832
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:23,798
High voice, falsetto.

833
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,401
JB, do you want more water?

834
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:36,809
There you go.

835
01:15:36,868 --> 01:15:39,248
So, he's got swelling
on both vocal cords,

836
01:15:39,303 --> 01:15:41,546
that's what indicates to me
he has some reflux.

837
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:43,678
The vocal strain is partly because

838
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,349
he's trying to sing through the redness
and thickness of the reflux.

839
01:15:46,477 --> 01:15:49,427
And then, on top of that, add the
infection that he had over the weekend,

840
01:15:49,513 --> 01:15:52,122
which is really what
threw him over the edge.

841
01:15:52,283 --> 01:15:55,631
I'd like him to try the vapors today
and see what difference that makes.

842
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:59,166
So, this just proves to the world
he's human.

843
01:15:59,223 --> 01:16:00,999
All right. Can we leave now?

844
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,800
-I'm pretty much done.
-All right.

845
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,844
-As long as you have enough medicine.
-We have enough.

846
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:21,283
You know,
I grew up worshiping this place.

847
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:24,487
And to think that
a 12-year-old kid I found on YouTube

848
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,027
is going to be in the Garden tomorrow.

849
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:32,835
It's gonna be... Yeah, I'm excited.

850
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:39,005
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

851
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,304
It was actually
a year and three days ago

852
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:46,042
that Justin and I were
in a sound pit just like this.

853
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,482
It was the first time
he had ever been in the Garden,

854
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:51,715
and we got invited to meet Taylor Swift
at her sold-out show,

855
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,017
the first time
she'd ever sold out the Garden.

856
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,989
And I remember the kids were

857
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:58,995
waving their hands side-to-side
all around these stands.

858
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:04,794
This is really what I want to do. I want
to be doing this the rest of my life.

859
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,131
Justin looked at me and said,
"I can do this."

860
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,764
And I said, "I believe you can."
He goes, "No, I can do it in a year"

861
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:15,007
He kind of believed it, but
at the same time, he was like, "Maybe.

862
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:19,073
"MSG's really hard to sell out.
it's a really iconic venue."

863
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:25,517
He looked at me and was like, "I can do
this. I don't care how hard I gotta work."

864
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,924
Scooter usually tells me to
believe in my dreams and just go for it.

865
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,221
But we wanted that Garden.

866
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,661
We looked at the route,
and I saw the first leg and they said,

867
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,756
"Maybe we'll save Madison Square
Garden for the second leg."

868
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,494
I said, "No, no, no. We're going for it."

869
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:46,601
So, we went on sale
and they call me and they're like,

870
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,509
"We're going to sell out
this entire tour in two days."

871
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:50,839
And I said, "What about the Garden?"

872
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,849
And they said, "The Garden?
That sold out an hour ago."

873
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,246
And I said, "What?"

874
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:58,253
They said,
"Yeah, we sold that out in 22 minutes."

875
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,619
Now we're less than 24 hours.

876
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,753
I'm nervous,
but I've seen him pull through,

877
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:09,627
so I got to believe that he can.

878
01:18:55,896 --> 01:18:57,706
Justin! I love you!

879
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:18,165
-Nobody's in there.
-No one's coming out.

880
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:19,687
Is it that one?

881
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:45,354
-What's up, buddy?
-How are you, man?

882
01:19:45,412 --> 01:19:47,291
-How you feeling?
-Feeling good.

883
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:50,298
What were you knuckleheads
doing out there, causing a ruckus?

884
01:19:54,854 --> 01:19:57,336
You're wearing my favorite color!

885
01:19:57,389 --> 01:19:59,531
I said I'd come and I was gonna be
dressed like you today.

886
01:19:59,592 --> 01:20:00,628
It's nice.

887
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:03,735
Kenny put me onto this kind of T-shirt,
these kind of shirts.

888
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,242
I would never have worn this
if it wasn't for Kenny.

889
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:10,147
-How you doing? Good with you.
-What up, man?

890
01:20:10,202 --> 01:20:11,546
-How are you?
-I'm good.

891
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:12,606
What up?

892
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:25,957
This is an honor.
it's an honor to perform with you guys.

893
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:27,521
While we're doing all this,

894
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,602
I want you to
keep your voice as still as you can.

895
01:20:29,688 --> 01:20:32,102
We're still not out of the woods yet.
We got a big show tonight.

896
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:33,194
So, no talking.

897
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:35,634
Wow. You're on the floor.

898
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:39,979
-Oh, my God!
-You are a saint! You are a saint!

899
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:41,478
Thank you so much!

900
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,977
It's not that bad.

901
01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:49,281
-Every show you knock that back.
-Breakfast of champions.

902
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,219
What does it do?

903
01:20:55,914 --> 01:20:58,396
All the nutrition
that your body ever needs.

904
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:02,668
Oh, God. This smells like liquid poop.

905
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:05,966
He's not gonna like it.
it's his first time having it, man.

906
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:08,734
It's like dinosaur pee.

907
01:21:08,793 --> 01:21:11,868
Wait till you hit the stage.
When you got that in your system...

908
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,274
When you get to
the second phase of the show...

909
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:14,811
I'm 16. I always have energy.

910
01:21:14,865 --> 01:21:17,610
Okay. But you won't be 16 forever.

911
01:21:21,672 --> 01:21:23,847
Group hug, fellas.

912
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:25,980
-Big moment tonight.
-Bring it in for the real thing.

913
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:30,894
You're family, the little man in our lives.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say

914
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:32,053
we're proud right now.

915
01:21:34,318 --> 01:21:35,765
-Love you.
-Love you, too, man.

916
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,063
Should he kill this now in front of you
so you know he drank it?

917
01:21:38,122 --> 01:21:40,628
Please.

918
01:21:40,691 --> 01:21:42,000
Finish it, man. Finish it.

919
01:21:42,059 --> 01:21:43,597
The last part's so bad.

920
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:46,439
Come on. it's not that bad, dude.

921
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:50,074
Ten minutes! Ten minutes!

922
01:21:55,505 --> 01:22:00,516
I was once chilling in my room,
watching TM just in a regular place.

923
01:22:00,644 --> 01:22:05,530
And now I'm in this big world,
living my dream and doing what I love.

924
01:22:07,617 --> 01:22:10,260
It's just crazy how it all came around.

925
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:25,613
Let's go!

926
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:27,240
Bring him down.

927
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:29,207
Got to roll.

928
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:41,958
New York City.
Are you having a good time so far?

929
01:22:42,018 --> 01:22:44,398
It's the My World Tour!

930
01:22:47,523 --> 01:22:51,168
I thank you for this day, and thank you
for the journey leading up to this day.

931
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:53,300
Protect everyone, including Justin,

932
01:22:53,362 --> 01:22:57,337
and bless everybody for your glory, God.
In Jesus' name.

933
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,211
-Amen.
-Amen.

934
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:01,677
Rock and roll, buddy.

935
01:23:03,273 --> 01:23:04,981
Everybody get in.

936
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:27,172
I got to tell you something, right?
It's a little motto to live by.

937
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:29,233
Basically, it goes like this.

938
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:32,378
There's gonna be times in your life
when people tell you

939
01:23:32,434 --> 01:23:34,712
that you can't do something.

940
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,810
And there's gonna be times in your life
when people say

941
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:39,648
that you can't live your dreams.

942
01:23:41,776 --> 01:23:44,316
And there's gonna be times in your life

943
01:23:45,413 --> 01:23:46,757
when people say

944
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:50,130
that you can't sell out
Madison Square Garden!

945
01:23:53,188 --> 01:23:55,363
This is what I tell them.

946
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:10,114
Never say never

947
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,417
Let's go!
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

948
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:19,056
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

949
01:26:11,857 --> 01:26:13,532
Yeah! Yeah!

950
01:26:16,095 --> 01:26:19,511
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!

951
01:27:36,306 --> 01:27:37,810
All right. You ready?

952
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:44,356
Get your, get your, get your hands up!
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

953
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,597
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

954
01:27:55,558 --> 01:27:59,408
Give it up for little bro,
Jay Smith, everybody!

955
01:28:05,402 --> 01:28:07,907
---if you came here to
fa!! in love with Justin Bieber,

956
01:28:08,004 --> 01:28:11,820
I want you to make some noise!

957
01:28:18,414 --> 01:28:22,925
I want Justin to be able to find
his identity and worth

958
01:28:22,986 --> 01:28:27,633
not from what he can do,
but from who he is.

959
01:28:32,294 --> 01:28:35,335
We've done the best we can
raising him.

960
01:28:35,397 --> 01:28:37,345
Hopefully, as he goes through life,

961
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:41,852
he'll remember what we've said to him
about being respectful to people,

962
01:28:41,904 --> 01:28:44,979
and being a good man.

963
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:50,390
There's so many people out there
who think he's just some kid act.

964
01:28:50,446 --> 01:28:53,862
That he's gonna be a teen sensation,
then he's going to go away.

965
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,021
I wouldn't bet against Justin,

966
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:58,261
and I sure would bet
against Justin and his team.

967
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,732
We like being the underdog.

968
01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:03,501
We'd like to stay the underdog
as long as possible.

969
01:29:03,659 --> 01:29:06,073
Kind of gives us something to work for.

970
01:29:07,996 --> 01:29:10,239
As he grows,
as he goes through life's experiences,

971
01:29:10,298 --> 01:29:14,341
as he loves, as he finds relationships,
all of this will become part of the story.

972
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:16,783
And, for me,
it's beautiful to watch it all over again

973
01:29:16,838 --> 01:29:19,047
because I understand it firsthand.

974
01:29:19,107 --> 01:29:24,221
I mean, this is something that could
definitely be a forever story.

975
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:25,645
Only if he wants it.

976
01:30:36,417 --> 01:30:37,761
New York!

977
01:34:18,768 --> 01:34:21,307
I love him!

978
01:35:00,642 --> 01:35:02,851
Good job out there, man.
Thank you so much for coming out.

979
01:35:12,487 --> 01:35:13,523
Amazing.

980
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:43,366
-Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin!
-Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin!

981
01:35:51,925 --> 01:35:55,137
MSG is a big deal for me.
You know, performing here.

982
01:35:55,195 --> 01:35:56,938
I'm really blessed to just be
in this position

983
01:35:56,997 --> 01:36:01,211
and have so many great fans
who have followed me since day one.

984
01:36:02,669 --> 01:36:04,948
And I want to thank everyone in here-

985
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:07,487
Let's do another song.
You want to do another song?

986
01:36:08,942 --> 01:36:10,581
Who wants to be my baby?

987
01:39:09,853 --> 01:39:10,855
Say what?

988
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:53,906
You came out with
what you went in with.

989
01:39:55,864 --> 01:40:00,648
Okay. All right. Now, let's cool it down.
Okay, Ninja Man?

990
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,706
Ninja Turtle. All right.

991
01:40:27,195 --> 01:40:28,675
Who wants to be my baby?

992
01:40:32,033 --> 01:40:35,017
This is my classmate from college.

993
01:40:35,069 --> 01:40:37,643
-We've known each other for 30 years.
-We've been hanging a long time.

994
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:50,997
Spidey.

995
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:55,303
The Segway sweat.

996
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:08,912
I'm in Australia. I'm here.
Look what I found just randomly.

997
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,977
What's up, man? it's a kangaroo.

998
01:41:12,673 --> 01:41:15,122
Does he have a Bieber shirt on?

999
01:44:31,434 --> 01:44:33,177
...give Justin the strength that he needs.

1000
01:44:33,237 --> 01:44:36,881
And, my God, help us to all understand
the responsibility that goes with

1001
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:39,650
what comes after this.

1002
01:44:41,544 --> 01:44:43,457
Bye. I love you.

1003
01:44:44,305 --> 01:44:50,324
