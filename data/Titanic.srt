1
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,810
All third-class passengers...

2
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,020
with a forward berth...

3
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,440
this way please! This queue!

4
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,480
It's a big boat?

5
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,690
Daddy, it's a ship.

6
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
You're right.

7
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,810
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

8
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,440
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

9
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,350
You can be blasé
about some things, Rose...

10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,270
but not about Titanic.

11
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,230
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

12
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,860
and far more luxurious.

13
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,150
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

14
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,410
So this is the ship they
say is unsinkable.

15
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,530
It is unsinkable.

16
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,030
God Himself
could not sink this ship...

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,160
What?!

18
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,750
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

19
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,040
It's round that way, sir.

20
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,870
I put my faith in you good sir.

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
Now kindly see my man.

22
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,420
Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

23
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,540
If I can do anything at all...

24
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,960
Yes, right.

25
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,210
All the trunks from
that car there.

26
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
12 from here.

27
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,470
And the safe,
to the parlor suite...

28
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,310
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

29
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Ladies...

30
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,480
we better hurry.

31
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,770
Come along.

32
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,530
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,950
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

34
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,630
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

35
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,920
It was the ship of dreams...

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,380
to everyone else.

37
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,670
To me. It was a slave ship...

38
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,180
taking me back to
America in chains.

39
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,180
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

40
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,020
Inside, I was screaming.

41
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,790
Jack, you are pazzo.

42
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,710
You bet everything we have.

43
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,040
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

44
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,510
Sven?

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,580
All right, moment of truth.

46
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,080
Someone's life is
about to change.

47
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,450
Fabrizio?

48
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,920
Niente.

49
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,090
Olaf?

50
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,250
Nothing.

51
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,760
Sven?

52
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,260
2 pair.

53
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,510
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,730
I'm sorry...

55
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,060
you're not gonna see
your mom again for a...

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,100
Long time...

57
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,860
'cause we're going to America.

58
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,230
Full house, boys!

59
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,620
Come on.

60
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm going home!

61
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,550
I'm going home.

62
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,010
I go to America!

63
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,630
No, mate.

64
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,880
Titanic go to America,

65
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,470
in 5 minutes.

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,010
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

67
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,140
Come on, here. Here.

68
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,350
We're riding in high style now!

69
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,900
We're a couple of
regular swells.

70
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,690
We're practically
goddamn royalty...

71
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,770
ragazzo mio.

72
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
You see? Is my destino.

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,530
Like I told you...

74
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,360
I go to America to
be millionaire.

75
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,740
You are pazzo.

76
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,580
Maybe, but I've
got the tickets.

77
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,910
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Aspetta!

79
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait! Wait!

80
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Hey, wait!

81
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,630
We're passengers!

82
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,800
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

83
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Of course.

84
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,430
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

85
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,430
We're Americans. Both of us.

86
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,510
Right.

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Come aboard.

88
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,520
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
You know that?

90
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,780
Good-bye!

91
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,870
You know somebody?

92
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,450
Of course not.
That's not the point.

93
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,040
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

94
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,500
Good-bye!

95
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,670
I will never forget you!

96
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,880
Come with me,
darling. Let's go.

97
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,760
G-60.

98
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,430
G-60. G-60.

99
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,850
Excuse me, ma'am.

100
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,100
G-60.

101
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,110
Oh, right here.

102
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,690
Hey, how you doing?

103
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,820
Jack. Nice to meet you.

104
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,610
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

105
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,070
How you doing?

106
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,120
Who says you get top bunk?

107
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,870
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,250
Will you be requiring anything?

109
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,790
Excuse me.

110
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,880
- This one?
- No.

111
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,380
It had a lot of faces on it.

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
This is the one.

113
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,800
Would you like all of
them out, miss?

114
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,310
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,350
Put in there. In the wardrobe.

116
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,570
God, not those finger
paintings again.

117
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,230
They certainly were a
waste of money.

118
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,320
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,990
and mine is that I have some.

120
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,070
They're fascinating.

121
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,580
Like being inside a dream
or something.

122
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,160
There's truth but no logic.

123
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,250
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

124
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,710
Something Picasso.

125
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,540
He won't amount to a thing.

126
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,880
He won't, trust me.

127
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,420
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

128
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,010
Put it in the wardrobe.

129
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,850
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

130
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,850
We all called her Molly.

131
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,360
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

132
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,820
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

133
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,070
Here, if you think
you can manage.

134
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.

135
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,830
And she was what Mother
called "new money."

136
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,330
By the next afternoon...

137
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,120
we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,500
with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,890
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,010
Let's stretch her legs.

141
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,470
Yes sir.

142
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,770
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

143
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,560
Very good, sir.

144
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,150
All ahead full.

145
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,280
All ahead full!

146
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,320
Come on lads, step lively!

147
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,970
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

148
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,380
We go full ahead!

149
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Come on, put your
backs into it!

150
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
21 knots, sir.

151
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,250
Hey, look, look, look!

152
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,830
See it?

153
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,170
There's another one! See him?

154
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,350
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

155
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,210
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

156
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,960
Very small, of course.

157
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,390
I'm the king of the world!

158
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,440
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

159
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,690
in all history.

160
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,150
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here...

161
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,110
designed her from the
keel plates up.

162
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
I may have knocked
her together, but...

163
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,570
the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

164
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,410
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

165
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,540
and so luxurious in...

166
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,660
its appointments...

167
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,870
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

168
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,540
And here she is.

169
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,090
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

170
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,800
I'll have the salmon.

171
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,300
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

172
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,140
She knows.

173
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,480
We'll both have the lamb.

174
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,730
Rare, with very
little mint sauce.

175
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,400
You like lamb, right sweet pea?

176
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,240
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal?

177
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,660
Hey, who thought of
the name Titanic?

178
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
Was it you, Bruce?

179
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, actually.

180
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,000
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

181
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
luxury, and above
all, strength.

182
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,840
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

183
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,430
His ideas about the male preoccupation with
size might be of particular interest to you.

184
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,180
What's gotten into you?

185
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,770
Excuse me.

186
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,690
I do apologize.

187
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,980
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

188
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,610
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

189
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,780
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

190
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,920
The ship is nice?

191
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

192
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,050
Is English, no?

193
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,180
No, it was built in Ireland.

194
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,090
15,000 Irishmen
built this ship.

195
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,930
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

196
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
That's typical.

197
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,770
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shite.

198
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,560
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

199
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,440
Like we could forget?

200
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm Tommy Ryan.

201
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,610
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

202
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,240
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

203
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,960
Forget it, boyo.

204
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,300
You'd as like have angels fly out of
your arse as get next to...

205
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,970
the likes of her.

206
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,330
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

207
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,160
An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...

208
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
yachts and polo matches.

209
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,840
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

210
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,180
I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice...

211
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,010
with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...

212
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,520
or even noticed.

213
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,090
Don't do it.

214
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,460
Stay back.

215
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,470
Don't come any closer.

216
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,260
Come on.

217
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,720
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

218
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,140
No! Stay where you are.

219
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
I mean it.

220
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,810
I'll let go.

221
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,320
No, you won't.

222
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,660
What do you mean, no I won't?

223
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,620
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

224
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,830
You don't know me.

225
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,170
Well, you would have done it already.

226
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,000
You're distracting me. Go away.

227
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,500
I can't.

228
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm involved now.

229
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,180
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

230
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,510
Don't be absurd.

231
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,010
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

232
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,180
The fall alone will kill you.

233
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,690
It would hurt. I'm not
saying it wouldn't.

234
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,480
Tell you the truth...

235
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,610
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

236
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,990
How cold?

237
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,540
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

238
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
You ever...

239
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,130
ever been to Wisconsin?

240
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,550
What?

241
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,050
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

242
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,220
I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls.

243
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,230
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

244
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,390
out on Lake Wissota.

245
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,230
Ice fishing is, you know, where you...

246
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,150
I know what ice fishing is!

247
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,570
Sorry.

248
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,400
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

249
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,740
Anyway, I...

250
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,740
fell through some thin ice.

251
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,580
And I'm telling you...

252
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,580
water that cold,

253
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,580
like right down there...

254
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,710
it hits you like 1000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

255
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,550
You can't breathe.

256
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,060
You can't think. Least not about
anything but the pain.

257
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,350
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

258
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Like I said...

259
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,940
I don't have a choice.

260
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,950
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

261
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,450
and get me off the hook here.

262
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,620
You're crazy.

263
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,120
That's what everybody says but...

264
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,290
with all due respect, miss...

265
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,130
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

266
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,300
Come on.

267
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,630
Come on, give me your hand.

268
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,800
You don't want to do this.

269
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm Jack Dawson.

270
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,490
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

271
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,490
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

272
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
Come on.

273
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
I got you.

274
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,670
Come on.

275
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,470
Help, please!

276
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,350
Help!

277
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,850
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

278
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,520
Listen. Listen to me.

279
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,350
I've got you. I won't let go.

280
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,650
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

281
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,690
Come on.

282
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,980
That's right.

283
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,610
You can do it.

284
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,870
I got you.

285
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,040
What's all this?

286
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,050
You stand back and...

287
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,800
don't move an inch!

288
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,260
Fetch the Master at Arms.

289
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,470
This is completely unacceptable!

290
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,390
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?!

291
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,230
Look at me, you filth!

292
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Cal.

293
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,860
What do you think
you were doing?

294
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,570
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

295
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,900
An accident?

296
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,570
It was.

297
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,740
Stupid, really.

298
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,080
I was leaning over and I slipped.

299
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,080
I was leaning far over
to see the...

300
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,750
The...

301
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,920
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

302
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,930
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

303
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,430
saved me. And almost
went over himself.

304
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,430
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

305
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,940
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

306
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,770
Was that the way of it?

307
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Yeah. Yeah, that
was pretty much it.

308
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,110
Well, the boy's a hero then.

309
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,030
Good for you, son. Well done.

310
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

311
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,290
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

312
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,290
Perhaps a little something
for the boy?

313
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,790
Of course.

314
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,630
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

315
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

316
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,470
Rose is displeased.

317
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,640
What to do?

318
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
I know.

319
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,980
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

320
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,820
to regale our group...

321
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,320
with your heroic tale.

322
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,820
Sure. Count me in.

323
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,490
Good. It's settled then.

324
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,830
This should be interesting.

325
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,840
Can I bum a smoke?

326
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,850
You'll want to tie those.

327
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,600
It's interesting...

328
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,940
the young lady slipped
so suddenly...

329
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,530
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

330
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,710
I know you've been melancholy.

331
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,710
I don't pretend to know why.

332
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,550
I intended to save this...

333
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:42,720
until the engagement
gala next week...

334
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,400
but, I thought...

335
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,060
tonight.

336
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,730
Good gracious.

337
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,400
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

338
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,530
- Is it a...
- Diamond. Yes.

339
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,240
56 carats to be exact.

340
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,580
It was worn by Louis XVI.

341
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,750
And they called
it Le Coeur de la Mer.

342
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,090
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

343
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,260
It's overwhelming.

344
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,390
Well, it's for royalty.

345
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,770
We are royalty, Rose.

346
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,110
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

347
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
There's nothing I'd deny you...

348
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,780
if you would not deny me.

349
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,290
Open your heart to me, Rose.

350
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,680
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

351
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,810
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country...

352
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,610
so I lit on out of there and I
haven't been back since.

353
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,980
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

354
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,660
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and...

355
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,950
chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew up...

356
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,830
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

357
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,830
- Mr. Dawson, I...
- Jack.

358
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,250
Jack.

359
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,920
I want to thank you
for what you did.

360
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,680
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

361
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,350
You're welcome.

362
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,850
Look.

363
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,600
I know what you
must be thinking.

364
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,480
Poor little rich girl.

365
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,770
What does she know about misery?

366
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
No.

367
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,190
No, that's not what I was thinking.

368
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,780
What I was thinking was...

369
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,370
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

370
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Well I...

371
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,830
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

372
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,130
all the people in it.

373
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,960
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

374
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,010
powerless to stop it.

375
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
God, look at that thing.

376
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,680
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

377
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,890
500 invitations have gone out.

378
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,890
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

379
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,190
And all the while I feel I'm...

380
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,480
standing in the middle
of a crowded room...

381
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,230
screaming at the
top of my lungs...

382
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,570
and no one even looks up.

383
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Do you love him?

384
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
Pardon me?

385
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,530
Do you love him?

386
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,080
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

387
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,080
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

388
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,590
This is not a suitable conversation.

389
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,090
Why can't you just
answer the question?

390
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,720
This is absurd.

391
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,430
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

392
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

393
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,270
and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

394
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,440
Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

395
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,360
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

396
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,570
And you've insulted me.

397
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,400
Well, you deserved it.

398
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,780
- Right.
- Right.

399
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,410
I thought you were leaving.

400
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,950
I am.

401
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,450
You are so annoying.

402
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Wait.

403
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,460
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

404
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

405
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,470
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

406
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,970
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

407
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,980
These are rather good.

408
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,490
They're very good, actually.

409
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,500
Jack, this is exquisite work.

410
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,500
They didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

411
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,000
Paris?

412
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,960
You do get around for a p...

413
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,470
Well, a... a
person of limited means.

414
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

415
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,680
Well, well, well.

416
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,650
And these were drawn from life?

417
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,200
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

418
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,110
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

419
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,040
You liked this woman.

420
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,040
You used her several times.

421
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
Well.

422
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

423
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,720
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

424
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
No, no, no.
Just with her hands.

425
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,220
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

426
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,350
See?

427
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
She had a good
sense of humor though.

428
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Oh, and this lady...

429
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
She used to sit at this bar every night...

430
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,080
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

431
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,660
just waiting for
her long, lost love.

432
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,750
We called her Madame Bijoux.

433
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,090
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

434
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,590
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

435
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,260
You do.

436
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,090
You see people.

437
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,930
I see you.

438
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,680
And?

439
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,770
You wouldn't have jumped.

440
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,740
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

441
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,610
Rose has already done that.

442
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,780
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

443
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,790
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

444
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,410
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

445
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,120
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

446
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,710
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

447
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,960
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

448
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,640
Countess.

449
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,970
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

450
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,930
No, I don't see the need.

451
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,810
We are making excellent time.

452
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,650
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

453
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,150
We must give them
something new to print.

454
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,160
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

455
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,240
make headlines.

456
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,500
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

457
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,330
until they've been properly run in.

458
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,960
Of course I'm just a passenger.

459
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,420
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

460
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,670
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

461
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,430
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night...

462
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,180
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

463
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,970
Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?

464
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,020
Good man.

465
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,940
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

466
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,860
then I went to Los Angeles to the...

467
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,280
Santa Monica pier
and did portraits for 10 cents each.

468
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,870
Why can't I be like you?

469
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,700
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

470
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,460
Say we'll go there
sometime, to that pier...

471
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,880
only if we just talk about it.

472
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,050
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

473
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,050
Ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

474
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,550
We'll ride horses on the
beach, in the surf.

475
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,890
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

476
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,060
You mean with one leg on each side?

477
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Can you show me?

478
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,480
Sure, if you like.

479
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,730
Teach me to ride like a man.

480
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,320
Chew tobacco like a man.

481
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,070
And spit like a man.

482
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,160
You didn't learn in finishing school?

483
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,580
No.

484
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,750
Come on, I'll show you.

485
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
I'll show you how.

486
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,920
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

487
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,250
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

488
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,260
Watch closely.

489
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,760
That's disgusting.

490
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,930
Your turn.

491
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,270
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

492
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

493
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
You see the range on that thing?

494
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,940
Okay, go.

495
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,450
That was better. You have to work on it.
Really try to hawk it up.

496
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,710
Mother.

497
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,470
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

498
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,470
Charmed, I'm sure.

499
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,810
The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.

500
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,980
But my mother looked at him like an insect.

501
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,490
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

502
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,660
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

503
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,330
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

504
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,330
Shall we go dress, Mother?

505
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,170
See you at dinner, Jack.

506
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,170
Son?

507
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Son!

508
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,680
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

509
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Not really.

510
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,520
You're about to go into the snake pit.

511
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,600
What are you going to wear?

512
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,690
I figured. Come on.

513
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,700
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

514
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,700
Pretty close.

515
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,710
You shine up like a new penny.

516
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,220
Good evening, sir.

517
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,290
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

518
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,620
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

519
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,040
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. Where's Rose?

520
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,630
She'll be along.

521
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
There is the Countess.

522
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,330
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

523
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,930
Darling...

524
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,680
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

525
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,100
It's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

526
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,520
Almost.

527
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,280
This is extraordinary.

528
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,540
This is a remarkable voyage.

529
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,210
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

530
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
There's the Countess of Rothes.

531
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,050
That's John Jacob Astor...

532
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,390
the richest man on board.

533
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,560
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

534
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,400
See how she tries to hide it.

535
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,060
Quite the scandal.

536
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,070
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

537
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,990
is at home with the children, of course.
And over here...

538
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,910
Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

539
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,490
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

540
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,080
Very popular with the royals.

541
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,920
Congratulations. She's splendid.

542
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,750
Why, thank you.

543
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,000
Escort a lady to dinner?

544
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,760
Certainly.

545
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,090
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

546
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,340
Ain't nothing to it.

547
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,600
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

548
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,440
Hey, Astor.

549
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,940
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

550
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,110
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

551
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,860
Well, Jack...

552
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,950
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

553
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,540
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

554
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh, yes.

555
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,130
He must have been nervous.
But he never faltered.

556
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,130
They assumed he was one of them.

557
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,630
Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.

558
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,140
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

559
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,220
Mother. Of course.
Could always be counted upon.

560
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,730
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

561
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,400
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

562
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,320
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

563
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,910
He was of help to my fiancée last night.

564
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,000
It happens Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

565
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,830
He showed me some of his work today.

566
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,170
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
Not to impugn your work, sir.

567
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Are all these mine?

568
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,350
Start from the outside and work in.

569
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
He knows every rivet in her.

570
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,190
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

571
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,780
Thank you, Rose.

572
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,530
How do you take your caviar, sir?

573
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,030
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

574
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,540
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

575
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

576
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,210
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

577
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,630
How do you have means to travel?

578
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,720
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

579
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,720
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

580
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,470
A very lucky hand.

581
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,390
All life is a game of luck.

582
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,480
A real man makes his own luck.
Right, Dawson?

583
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,990
And you find
that sort of rootless existence appealing?

584
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,660
Yes, ma'am, I do.

585
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,410
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

586
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,500
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

587
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,340
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

588
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,670
Where I'll wind up.

589
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,340
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

590
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,850
now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

591
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
I'll take more of that.

592
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,440
Life's a gift. I don't
intend on wasting it.

593
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,270
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

594
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,280
You take life as it comes at you.
Here, Cal.

595
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,530
Make each day count.

596
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Well said, Jack.

597
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,700
Hear, hear.

598
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,620
To making it count.

599
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Bravo.

600
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,800
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

601
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,140
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and lights a fire.

602
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,810
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

603
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,070
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

604
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,410
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

605
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Ladies, thank you for your company.

606
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,410
May I escort you to the cabin?

607
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,660
No, I'll stay here.

608
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Here, Molly.

609
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Joining us, Dawson?

610
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,170
You don't want to stay with the women.

611
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,010
No, thanks. I have to head back.

612
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,010
That's best. It'll be all business and politics.
Wouldn't interest you.

613
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,760
But Dawson, good of you to come.

614
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,690
Must you go?

615
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,270
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

616
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,200
Good night, Rose.

617
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,740
Want to go to a real party?

618
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,330
Is okay I put my hand here?

619
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
I can't understand you.

620
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,560
I'm going to dance with her now.

621
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Come on.

622
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,310
Come on. Come with me.

623
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,480
Jack. Jack, wait.

624
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
I can't do this.

625
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,900
We'll have to get a bit closer.

626
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,320
Like this.

627
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,320
You're still my best girl, Cora.

628
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,750
- I don't know the steps.
- Me, either. Just go with it.

629
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,580
Don't think.

630
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,350
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

631
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,700
What? Wait!

632
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,580
Jack, no.

633
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,080
Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

634
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,170
That's what Rockefeller said...
Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

635
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,110
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

636
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,370
Get out of here.

637
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,280
Are you all right?

638
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,290
I'm fine.

639
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
Two out of three.

640
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,790
So...

641
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
you think you're tough?

642
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,800
Let's see you do this.

643
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,800
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

644
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,570
Jesus!

645
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,990
You okay?

646
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,830
I haven't done that in years.

647
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,670
Come on, lads. Give it all you got.
Let's go.

648
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,030
Coffee, sir?

649
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,630
You didn't come to me last night.

650
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,380
I was tired.

651
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,550
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

652
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,220
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

653
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,480
You will never behave like that again.

654
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,070
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

655
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,240
I'm your fiancée.

656
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,910
My fiancée. My fiancée!

657
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Yes, you are! And my wife!

658
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,080
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

659
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,170
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

660
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,670
Because I will not be made a fool of.

661
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,340
Is this in any way unclear?

662
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,430
No.

663
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,100
Good. Excuse me.

664
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,440
Oh, Miss Rose.

665
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,690
We had a little accident.

666
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,110
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

667
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,530
Let me help you.

668
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,380
It's all right, miss.

669
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,290
Tea, Trudy.

670
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,980
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

671
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,650
Rose, I forbid it.

672
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,650
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

673
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,660
This is not a game.

674
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,830
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

675
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,500
Of course I know.
You remind me every day.

676
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,420
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

677
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,340
That name is the only card we have to play.

678
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,680
I don't understand you.

679
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,350
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

680
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,350
How can you put this on me?

681
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,100
Why are you being so selfish?

682
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm being selfish?

683
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,860
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

684
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,530
Is that what you want?

685
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,040
To see our fine things sold at auction?

686
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,540
Our memories scattered?

687
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,390
It's so unfair.

688
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,560
Of course it's unfair.

689
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,230
We're women.

690
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,900
Our choices are never easy.

691
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,590
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

692
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,760
From every peril on the land

693
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,770
O, spirit whom the Father sent

694
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,610
To spread abroad the firmament

695
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,280
O, wind of heaven, by Thy might

696
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,450
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

697
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,620
And keep them by Thy watchful care...

698
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,960
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

699
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,640
I need to talk to someone.

700
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,140
You're not supposed to be in here.

701
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,390
I was here last night, remember?

702
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,310
No. Now please turn around.

703
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,400
He'll tell you. I just need to talk...

704
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,820
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

705
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,990
are still appreciative
of your assistance.

706
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,830
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude...

707
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,660
I don't want your money.

708
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,830
And remind you you are
in third class and your presence here...

709
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,830
is no longer appropriate.

710
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,420
Let me speak to Rose.

711
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,670
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

712
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,680
and that he stays there?

713
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:30,510
Yes, sir.

714
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,930
Come along, you.

715
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,180
Hear us when we cry to Thee

716
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,020
For those in peril on the sea

717
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,860
Why are there two steering wheels?

718
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,610
We use this one near shore.

719
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,530
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the Noordam.

720
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,120
Thank you, Sparks.

721
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,700
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

722
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,710
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

723
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,720
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

724
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,550
Okay, now let it go.

725
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,600
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

726
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,610
Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.

727
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,650
I did the sum in my head...

728
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,780
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

729
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,620
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

730
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,120
About half, actually.

731
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,460
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

732
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,460
In fact, I put in these new
type davits...

733
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:47,420
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

734
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,090
But it was thought, by some...

735
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,840
the deck would look
too cluttered.

736
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,640
So, I was overruled.

737
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,140
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

738
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,140
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

739
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,850
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

740
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,810
She's all the lifeboat
you need.

741
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,150
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

742
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,830
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

743
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,000
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

744
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,830
Jack. I'm engaged.

745
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,670
I'm marrying Cal.

746
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,630
I love Cal.

747
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,510
Rose...

748
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,510
you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

749
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:43,350
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding...

750
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,350
wonderful girl...

751
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,810
woman, that I've ever known.

752
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,980
Jack, I...

753
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,740
No, let me try and get
this out. You're ama...

754
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,200
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

755
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,410
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

756
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,330
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

757
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,210
I understand.

758
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,830
But I'm too involved now.

759
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,210
You jump, I jump. Remember?

760
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,050
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

761
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
That's all that I want.

762
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,720
Well, I'm fine.

763
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:21,390
I'll be fine. Really.

764
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,560
Really?

765
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,230
I don't think so.

766
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,360
They've got you trapped, Rose.

767
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,900
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

768
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,070
Maybe not right away...

769
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,860
because you're strong...

770
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,570
but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose...

771
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,410
that fire is gonna burn out.

772
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,040
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

773
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,750
You're right.

774
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,760
Only you can do that.

775
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,270
I'm going back.

776
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,100
Leave me alone.

777
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:19,780
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

778
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,740
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

779
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,120
Oh, my dear.

780
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,950
And the dreadful
bridesmaids' gowns.

781
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,420
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

782
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,920
Rose decided she
wanted lavender.

783
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,840
She knows I detest the color.

784
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,590
So, she did it only to spite me.

785
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,800
If only you'd come to
me sooner.

786
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,930
Ruth saw some of my designs in
La Mode Illustrée.

787
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,470
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

788
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
They were quite charming.

789
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,680
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

790
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,150
we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

791
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,950
Hello, Jack.

792
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,500
I changed my mind.

793
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,680
They said you might be up here.

794
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,010
Give me your hand.

795
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,860
Now close your eyes.

796
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,520
Go on.

797
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,360
Now, step up.

798
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,490
Now, hold onto the railing.

799
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,580
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

800
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,830
I'm not.

801
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,210
Now, step up onto the rail.

802
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,210
Hold on. Hold on.

803
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,550
Keep your eyes closed.

804
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,390
Do you trust me?

805
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,220
I trust you.

806
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,060
All right...

807
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,940
open your eyes.

808
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,030
I'm flying.

809
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,530
Jack.

810
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,770
Come, Josephine, in my
flying machine. Going up...

811
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:00,940
she goes. Up she goes.

812
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,660
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

813
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,210
We're up to dusk the
night of the sinking.

814
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,290
6 hours to go.

815
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,460
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there and...

816
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,210
he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...

817
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:05,470
excuse me... his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

818
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,840
26 years of experience
working against him.

819
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,140
He figures anything big
enough to sink, the ship...

820
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,060
they're gonna see in time to turn.

821
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,810
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

822
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,020
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

823
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,520
Everything he knows is wrong.

824
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,040
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

825
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,540
- Will this light do?
- What?

826
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,210
Don't artists need good light?

827
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,710
That is true, but I'm not
used to working in...

828
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,090
such horrible conditions.

829
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,220
Monet!

830
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,720
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

831
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,060
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

832
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:59,350
I know. It's extraordinary.

833
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,190
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

834
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,530
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

835
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,370
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

836
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,740
That's nice.

837
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,790
What is it, a sapphire?

838
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,710
A diamond.

839
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,790
A very rare diamond.

840
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,220
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

841
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:31,930
Wearing this.

842
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,430
All right.

843
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,270
Wearing only this.

844
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,470
The last thing I need is another picture
of me looking like a porcelain doll.

845
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,430
As a paying customer...

846
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,310
I expect to get what I want.

847
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,960
Over on the bed... the couch.

848
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,140
Come. Lie down.

849
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,140
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

850
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,190
Put your arm back
the way it was.

851
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,020
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

852
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,530
Right.

853
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,700
Now, head down.

854
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,200
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

855
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,370
And try to stay still.

856
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,890
So serious.

857
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,270
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

858
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,610
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

859
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,610
He does landscapes.

860
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,450
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

861
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,120
No laughing.

862
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:18,150
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

863
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,490
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

864
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,500
up until then, at least.

865
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,790
So what happened next?

866
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,340
You mean, did we do it?

867
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,170
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

868
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,180
Jack was very professional.

869
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,350
Thank you.

870
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,820
What are you doing?

871
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,990
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

872
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,880
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

873
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,220
None of the stewards
have seen her.

874
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,010
This is absurd. It's a ship.

875
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,260
There's only so many
places she could be.

876
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,220
Lovejoy, find her.

877
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:48,870
- Clear.
- Yes.

878
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,080
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

879
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,580
Like a mill pond.

880
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,290
Not a breath of wind.

881
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,420
It will make the bergs
harder to see...

882
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,720
with no breaking
water at the base.

883
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,230
Well, I'm off.

884
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:20,480
Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.

885
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,490
Yes, sir.

886
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,120
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

887
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,790
Miss Rose?

888
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,960
My drawings!

889
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,280
Come on!

890
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:13,330
Wait, wait, wait!

891
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,830
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

892
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Bye.

893
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,680
Sorry.

894
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,690
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

895
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,830
Pretty tough for
a valet, this fella.

896
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,660
Seems more like a cop.

897
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,000
I think he was.

898
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,330
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

899
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,710
No, over here!

900
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,210
Quick!

901
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,390
Now what?

902
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,020
What?

903
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,900
More coal for number one, mate.

904
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,690
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

905
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,230
You shouldn't be down here.

906
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,610
It could be dangerous!

907
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,030
Carry on!

908
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,290
Don't mind us. You're
doing a great job!

909
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,950
Keep up the good work!

910
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,260
Look at what we have here?

911
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,780
Thank you.

912
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,300
Where to, miss?

913
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,130
To the stars.

914
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,650
You nervous?

915
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,280
No.

916
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,180
Put your hands on me, Jack.

917
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,700
It's bloody cold.

918
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,710
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

919
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,370
Bollocks!

920
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,380
Well, I can, all right?

921
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,840
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

922
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,880
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

923
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,880
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

924
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
Cheerio.

925
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,420
You're trembling.

926
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,920
Don't worry.

927
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,800
I'll be all right.

928
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,950
- They ran down there.
- Right.

929
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,370
Anything missing?

930
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,230
I have a better idea.

931
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,250
Got you!

932
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,340
Did you see those guys' faces?

933
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,760
Did you see them?

934
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,940
When the ship docks...

935
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,020
I'm getting off with you.

936
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,440
This is crazy.

937
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,450
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

938
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,450
That's why I trust it.

939
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,130
Here, look at this.

940
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,960
Look at that, would you?

941
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,800
They're warmer than we are.

942
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,550
If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
I'd rather not.

943
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,320
Bugger me!

944
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,160
Pick up, you bastards!

945
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,830
Is anyone there?!

946
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,250
What do you see?

947
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,920
Iceberg, right ahead!

948
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:16,250
Thank you.

949
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:19,590
Iceberg ahead!

950
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,760
Hard a' starboard!

951
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,930
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

952
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:37,190
Full astern!

953
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,520
Hard over.

954
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:42,360
Helm's hard over, sir.

955
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,530
Go, lads, go!

956
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,700
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

957
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,370
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

958
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,210
Hold it.

959
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,050
Hold it!

960
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,220
Now! Engage reversing engine!

961
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,750
Why ain't they turning?

962
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,170
Is it hard over?!

963
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,420
It is, sir. Hard over.

964
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,600
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

965
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,110
Yes.

966
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,950
It's going to hit!

967
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,880
Jesus Christ!

968
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,820
Jesus!

969
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:48,650
Hard to port!

970
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,000
Get back!

971
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,780
Let's go!

972
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,360
They're closing the doors! Get out!

973
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,210
Get out the door! Go!

974
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:46,540
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

975
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,890
Go! Go!

976
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,390
Out! Out!

977
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,740
Oh, my God.

978
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,910
That was a close shave.

979
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,160
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

980
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,090
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

981
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,510
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

982
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,850
An iceberg, sir.

983
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,430
I put her hard to starboard,
but it was too close.

984
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,940
I tried to port round it, but...

985
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,440
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

986
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:53,780
All stop.

987
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,290
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

988
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:20,300
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

989
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,980
Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.

990
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,900
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

991
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,980
That's the shudder you felt.
Do you need anything?

992
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,900
No, thank you.

993
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,330
There's talk of an iceberg.

994
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,330
I don't see anything. Do you?

995
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,670
If this is where the rats
are going, I am, too.

996
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,340
- You.
- There is no emergency.

997
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,430
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

998
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,680
Now, you moron!

999
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,690
Did I miss the fun?

1000
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:15,530
- Did you see what happened?
- No. I guess it hit over there.

1001
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:20,950
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1002
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,620
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1003
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:27,040
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

1004
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,290
This is bad.

1005
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,210
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1006
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,380
I think they're very good, sir.

1007
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,220
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

1008
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,390
We've been looking for you, miss.

1009
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,320
Here we go.

1010
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,660
Something serious has happened.

1011
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,740
Yes, it has.

1012
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:10,660
Indeed.
Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1013
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:15,090
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

1014
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,170
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

1015
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:22,340
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1016
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,680
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1017
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,100
This is horseshit!

1018
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,770
Don't you believe it.

1019
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,440
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

1020
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,190
I was with him the entire time.

1021
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,440
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1022
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,360
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1023
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:46,450
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket.

1024
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,200
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1025
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,040
That was reported stolen.

1026
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,880
I just borrowed it.

1027
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:58,460
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1028
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,960
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1029
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
Don't believe them. You know it.

1030
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,050
Let's go, son.

1031
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,140
You know I didn't do it!

1032
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:10,470
There's a good lad. Come on.

1033
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:13,140
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1034
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,310
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1035
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:24,240
Water fourteen feet above the keel
in ten minutes...

1036
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:27,820
in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1037
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,080
That's right.

1038
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,660
When can we get underway?

1039
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,910
That's five compartments.

1040
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:38,840
She can float with four compartments
breached, but not five.

1041
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,170
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

1042
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,590
over the tops of the bulkheads
at E deck, one to the next...

1043
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:50,510
back and back. There's no stopping it.

1044
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:52,100
The pumps.

1045
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,520
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1046
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:58,440
As of now, no matter what we do...

1047
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,530
Titanic will founder.

1048
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,200
But this ship can't sink.

1049
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:08,280
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1050
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:09,870
And she will.

1051
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,790
It's a mathematical certainty.

1052
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,710
How much time?

1053
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,720
An hour. Two, at most.

1054
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,810
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1055
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,060
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1056
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,240
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. Ismay.

1057
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,930
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1058
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,930
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1059
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,350
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1060
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,020
You've been asked to put on lifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

1061
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,270
I said, not now.

1062
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,530
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's
Captain's orders. Dress warmly.

1063
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:27,940
It's quite cold out.

1064
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,110
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1065
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,280
This is ridiculous.

1066
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:37,620
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1067
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,960
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1068
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,210
What's he on about?

1069
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:45,960
- Put your lifebelts on!
- What is it?

1070
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:47,550
Just put them on.

1071
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,970
C.Q. D?

1072
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,800
Sir?

1073
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:57,310
That's right, C.Q.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

1074
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,150
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

1075
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:17,990
Blimey.

1076
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:32,340
Keep lowering!

1077
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:40,020
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1078
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:47,860
Uncover this boat! Uncover
all the boats aft!

1079
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,860
Release those ties!

1080
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,950
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1081
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,030
Where are the passengers?

1082
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,620
They went inside. Too
cold and noisy for them.

1083
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:03,210
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1084
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,220
Care for a drink, sir?

1085
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:26,650
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed
up and now we're cooling our heels.

1086
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,400
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1087
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:32,400
Nobody knows what's going on.

1088
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:35,570
Just like the damn English...
everything by the book.

1089
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:38,580
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1090
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:43,580
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

1091
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:55,430
Mr. Andrews.

1092
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:00,760
I saw the iceberg. And
I see it in your eyes.

1093
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,770
Please tell me the truth.

1094
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,780
The ship will sink.

1095
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,530
You're certain?

1096
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:21,450
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1097
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,460
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

1098
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,630
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1099
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,470
You remember what I told
you about the boats?

1100
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,140
Yes.

1101
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:42,470
I understand.

1102
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,820
Over here, son.

1103
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:55,990
Sir, there's a big mob
at the Second Class Purser's office.

1104
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,070
Go on. I'll watch him.

1105
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,820
Aye. Right.

1106
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:19,510
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
Full steam for them, sir.

1107
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,760
She's the only one responding?

1108
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:26,600
The only one close. They'll
be here in four hours.

1109
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,020
Four hours?!

1110
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,530
Thank you, Bride.

1111
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,530
My God.

1112
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1113
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:58,460
Hadn't we better get the women and children
into the boats?

1114
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,380
Yes.

1115
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,730
Women and children first, yes.

1116
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:11,560
Yes, sir.

1117
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,070
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1118
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:20,070
Step this way, please. That's right.

1119
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,240
Come towards me. Thank you.

1120
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,240
Good.

1121
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:29,750
For the time being,
I require only women and children.

1122
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:31,410
Right here.

1123
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,090
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1124
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:38,420
"Wedding Dance."

1125
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:49,430
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1126
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:52,440
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1127
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,770
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1128
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:03,450
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1129
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,450
Please, stay calm.

1130
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,950
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1131
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:11,700
Let women and children
through to the front.

1132
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,290
What are we doing?

1133
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,630
Waiting. Once first-class people
are in the boats...

1134
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,210
they'll start with us
and we want to be ready.

1135
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,630
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1136
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,300
Go get help.

1137
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:29,640
Lower it away, left and
right together! Steady.

1138
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:33,310
Both sides together! Steady!

1139
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,480
Steady!

1140
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,980
Stop, stop, stop!

1141
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,990
Hold the left!

1142
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,820
Right side only! Right side only!

1143
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,320
Right side!

1144
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:50,490
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1145
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,330
Steady, lads!

1146
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:45,210
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1147
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:51,890
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1148
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,060
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1149
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:06,490
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

1150
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,950
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

1151
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,490
Only women at this time, sir.

1152
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:16,200
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1153
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,830
I hope they're not too crowded.

1154
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:23,460
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1155
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:25,510
Don't you understand?

1156
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:27,720
The water is freezing and
there aren't enough boats.

1157
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,630
Not enough by half.

1158
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:33,010
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

1159
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,970
Not the better half.

1160
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:37,890
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1161
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,350
First class seats
are right up here.

1162
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,360
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

1163
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,070
It'll be worth a lot
more by morning.

1164
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,700
You unimaginable bastard.

1165
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:54,490
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1166
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,410
Come on, Rose.

1167
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:59,540
You're next, darling.

1168
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:01,040
Come into the boat, Rose.

1169
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Come.

1170
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,880
Rose.

1171
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,010
Get into the boat!

1172
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:10,510
Rose.

1173
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,840
Good-bye, Mother.

1174
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,520
Where are you going?

1175
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:20,230
To him?!

1176
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,690
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1177
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:26,230
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1178
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,740
No!

1179
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:33,450
I said, no!

1180
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:37,080
Rose! Please, stop!

1181
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:39,700
And, lower away!

1182
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,040
No, Wait!

1183
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,120
Lower away!

1184
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,080
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1185
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,130
Hold the left side!

1186
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,050
Help!

1187
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:55,050
Can anybody hear me?!

1188
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,100
Hello! Help me!

1189
01:38:58,930 --> 01:38:59,930
Help me!

1190
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:02,770
Can you hear me?!

1191
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:07,110
Can anybody hear me?!
Somebody help me!

1192
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,780
Mr. Andrews?!

1193
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:15,620
Steward, check the
starboard corridor.

1194
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:18,410
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1195
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:21,580
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1196
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,660
Yes sir.

1197
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,620
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1198
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,790
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1199
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:29,420
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1200
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:31,300
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1201
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,420
No!

1202
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:34,760
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1203
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,300
But without will take longer.

1204
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,430
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

1205
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,770
down the crewmen's passage.

1206
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,520
Then go right and left
again at the stairs.

1207
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:46,940
You'll come to a long corridor.

1208
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,490
This could be bad.

1209
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,990
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1210
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:07,330
Excuse me. Thank you.

1211
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,840
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1212
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:17,510
I'm through being polite,
goddamnit!

1213
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:18,720
Now take me down!

1214
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:21,350
E deck.

1215
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:26,020
Come on.

1216
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,810
Come on, come on.

1217
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,000
I'm going back up.

1218
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,210
No! No! No!

1219
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,210
Come back! I'm going back up!

1220
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,550
I'm going back up!

1221
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,560
Crew passage.

1222
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,920
Jack!

1223
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,720
Rose!

1224
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:48,560
Rose, I'm in here!

1225
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,100
I'm in here!

1226
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,320
Jack! I'm sorry.

1227
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,990
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1228
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,360
That guy Lovejoy put
it in my pocket.

1229
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:03,320
I know, I know, I know.

1230
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:04,450
Listen Rose...

1231
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:07,040
you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1232
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,410
Look in that
cabinet right there.

1233
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,870
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1234
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:15,960
These are all brass ones!

1235
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,340
Check right here, Rose.

1236
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:23,930
Rose.

1237
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,850
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1238
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:28,310
I didn't.

1239
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:30,430
I just realized I already knew.

1240
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:34,020
Keep looking.

1241
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:44,410
No key.

1242
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:45,950
There's no key!

1243
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,030
All right, Rose, listen.

1244
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,740
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

1245
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,620
It'll be all right.

1246
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,460
I'll be right back.

1247
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,890
I'll just wait here!

1248
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:21,400
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1249
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:23,610
Hello?

1250
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,870
Is there anybody down here?

1251
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,870
We need help! Hello?

1252
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,580
Damnit!

1253
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:41,920
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

1254
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:45,260
Oh, thank God.

1255
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:46,720
Wait, please, I need your help.

1256
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:48,010
There's a man back
here and he's...

1257
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:49,890
Wait!

1258
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,440
Hello?!

1259
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:22,250
Hello?

1260
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,220
Miss, you shouldn't
be here now.

1261
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,720
I need your help.

1262
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:28,840
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

1263
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,050
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1264
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,220
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1265
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,310
You're going the wrong way!

1266
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,390
Let go of me! Listen!!!

1267
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:43,070
To hell with you.

1268
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,520
Oh, my God.

1269
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:16,160
Will this work?

1270
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,160
I guess we'll find out.

1271
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:19,830
Come on.

1272
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:23,920
Wait, wait, wait.

1273
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:26,090
Try a couple practice
swings over there.

1274
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,300
Good.

1275
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,390
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1276
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,560
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1277
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,320
You can do it.

1278
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:50,280
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1279
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:52,950
Come on. Wait.

1280
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:55,280
Open your
hands up a little more.

1281
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,950
- Like that?
- Right.

1282
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,000
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1283
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,960
Go.

1284
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,340
You did it!

1285
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:15,300
Come on. Let's go.

1286
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,970
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit!

1287
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,890
Shit! Shit!

1288
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,560
This is the way out.

1289
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:30,150
We have to find
another way. Come on.

1290
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:34,200
Pull.

1291
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,240
Put your backs into it.

1292
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,210
Pull!

1293
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:47,000
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1294
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,690
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1295
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:12,900
We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.

1296
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,780
This way.
Let go, sir. Get back.

1297
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,370
Keep calm!

1298
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:27,710
Lovejoy!

1299
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,090
She's not on the starboard side either.

1300
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:34,380
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1301
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,050
There's one on the other
side letting men on.

1302
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,010
Well then, that's our play.

1303
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,850
We'll need some
insurance first. Come on.

1304
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,810
This way, please.
All the way down here.

1305
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:48,900
Here!

1306
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:51,400
What do you think you're doing?

1307
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,900
You'll have to pay for
that, you know.

1308
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:55,900
That's White Star
Line property.

1309
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,740
Shut up!

1310
01:48:58,570 --> 01:49:01,740
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1311
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,620
Sit down!

1312
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,290
She's the last.

1313
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,210
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1314
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:09,290
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1315
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,580
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1316
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:14,000
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

1317
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:16,260
And I saw one boat
with only 12. 12!

1318
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:19,640
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1319
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:20,970
These boats may buckle.

1320
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,180
Rubbish!

1321
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:25,100
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1322
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,980
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1323
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,110
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1324
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:44,620
Get back in there!

1325
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:47,450
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

1326
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,710
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1327
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,960
Bring forward the women!

1328
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,800
Unlock the gates.

1329
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:00,630
Women only!

1330
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:04,810
No men!

1331
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:13,560
Get back!

1332
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:15,020
Lock the gates!

1333
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,190
Get them back from those gates!

1334
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:19,860
Don't touch the gates!

1335
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:24,870
For God's sake, man...

1336
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:26,540
there are women and
children down here!

1337
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:29,160
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1338
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:31,210
Get back!

1339
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,090
Tommy!

1340
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,670
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1341
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:39,420
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1342
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:44,600
The boats are all going.

1343
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,680
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1344
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:47,890
There is niente this way.

1345
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:50,270
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1346
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:57,520
I make my own luck.

1347
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,360
So do I.

1348
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,540
Come on!

1349
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,080
No, come on, let's go this way.

1350
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:20,800
This way!

1351
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,050
Just go back to
the main stairwell.

1352
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,510
And everything will be
sorted out there.

1353
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:28,810
It will all get sorted out back there.

1354
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:30,310
Go back to the main stairwell.

1355
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:32,390
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1356
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:33,980
Open the gate right now!

1357
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,310
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you.

1358
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:41,070
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1359
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,070
Stop that!

1360
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:48,030
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here.

1361
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:49,120
Move aside.

1362
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,370
Come on, pull!

1363
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:53,250
Pull!

1364
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,540
Move aside.
Quickly, move aside!

1365
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:56,670
Put that down!

1366
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:58,000
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1367
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,420
One! Two!

1368
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,510
Three!

1369
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:04,930
Again!

1370
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,970
Now, let's go!

1371
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:11,350
Let's go, Rose.

1372
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:13,600
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1373
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,780
Keep order! Keep order here!

1374
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:24,950
Back! Back! Back!

1375
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:30,530
Hold on to her!

1376
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,160
Pull her in!

1377
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,620
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1378
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,130
shoot you all like dogs!

1379
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:40,960
Keep order here!

1380
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,130
Keep order, I say.

1381
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:47,130
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1382
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,810
Right. Is everybody all right?
Nobody panic.

1383
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,650
Stay back.

1384
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:05,320
We're too late.

1385
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:08,660
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1386
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,450
He seems to be quite practical.

1387
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,660
Don't lower it!

1388
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:19,170
Cut the falls!

1389
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:26,510
Sit down!

1390
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,260
Stay back, you lot!

1391
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,680
Just stay back, the
lot of you! Stay back!

1392
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:38,020
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1393
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:41,020
Mr. Murdoch?

1394
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,860
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

1395
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:45,690
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1396
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:47,440
and I have a business
proposition for you.

1397
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,370
Come on, Rose.

1398
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:00,870
The boats are gone!

1399
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,220
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

1400
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:10,840
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1401
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,590
This way, I'll lead you.

1402
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:22,150
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1403
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,940
Well, they don't listen to
us at dinner, either.

1404
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:25,150
Come on, let's play.

1405
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:26,610
Keep us warm.

1406
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,740
"Orpheus."

1407
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,370
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1408
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,590
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1409
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,760
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1410
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:05,110
Will the men please hold
back! Hold back, I say!

1411
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,240
Women and children only!

1412
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,320
Get back!

1413
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:15,280
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

1414
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:19,620
You better check the
other side. Go!

1415
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,800
I found her, on the other side.

1416
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,880
Waiting for a boat.

1417
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:32,380
With him.

1418
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,140
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1419
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,310
Anyone else then?

1420
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,310
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1421
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,480
Goddamn it all to hell.

1422
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:53,490
Shit.

1423
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:54,780
Fire!

1424
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,120
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

1425
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:04,080
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1426
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,670
Prepare to lower.

1427
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,670
Ready on the left.

1428
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,260
Take them down.

1429
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:27,440
Keep it steady.

1430
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:34,030
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1431
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:36,400
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1432
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,570
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1433
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,580
Daddy, get in the boat.

1434
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:44,750
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

1435
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,040
There'll be another
boat for the daddies.

1436
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:48,790
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

1437
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,000
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1438
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:53,840
I'm not going without you.

1439
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,630
No, you have to go, now.

1440
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:56,760
No, Jack.

1441
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,180
Get in the boat, Rose.

1442
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,430
No, Jack.

1443
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:00,510
Yes.

1444
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:01,600
Get on the boat!

1445
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,020
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1446
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:08,020
Oh my God, look at you.

1447
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:10,110
You look a fright.

1448
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:11,190
Here.

1449
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:15,110
Put this on. Come.

1450
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:21,950
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1451
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,040
No, not without you.

1452
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:26,120
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1453
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,290
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1454
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:29,920
Now, go on. Get on.

1455
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,090
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1456
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:34,090
Jack and I can get off safely.

1457
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:35,630
Both of us.

1458
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:37,880
See?

1459
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:39,010
I got my own boat to catch.

1460
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,800
Go on, hurry.

1461
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,300
They're almost full.

1462
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:44,930
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go. Go.

1463
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:47,980
Step aboard, please.

1464
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,690
You're daddy's
good girl, all right?

1465
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:50,900
You're my little sailor.

1466
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:56,150
Clear the rail, please.

1467
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,070
And, lower away!

1468
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,250
You're a good liar.

1469
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,840
Almost as good as you.

1470
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:25,180
There's no... there's no
arrangement, is there?

1471
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,020
No, there is.

1472
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:30,520
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1473
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:34,110
I always win, Jack.

1474
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:36,860
One way or another.

1475
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,040
Rose!

1476
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,420
Stop her!

1477
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:41,170
Rose, what are you doing?!

1478
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,260
No!

1479
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,950
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that?

1480
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:12,290
You're so stupid, Rose.

1481
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:15,290
Why did you do that? Why?!

1482
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:18,630
You jump, I jump, right?

1483
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:21,500
Right.

1484
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,760
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1485
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,220
I couldn't go, Jack.

1486
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,970
It's all right. We'll
think of something.

1487
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,140
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

1488
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:48,660
Come on! Move!

1489
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:52,990
Come on! Move.

1490
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:00,790
Come on!

1491
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:09,930
Move!

1492
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:17,690
Come on! Come on Rose.

1493
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:21,270
Rose, come on!

1494
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:25,320
Move Rose!

1495
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:29,410
Go!

1496
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,710
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1497
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:59,060
What could possibly be funny?

1498
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,230
I put the diamond in the coat.

1499
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:06,900
And I put the coat on her!

1500
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:09,740
Come on!

1501
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,430
Dada!

1502
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,890
We can't leave him.

1503
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,770
All right, come on!

1504
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,610
Dada!

1505
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,040
Go back!

1506
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:10,920
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1507
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:13,590
No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!

1508
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:19,810
Go!

1509
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:25,810
Go! Run!

1510
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:52,510
This way!

1511
02:04:04,690 --> 02:04:05,850
Give me your hand!

1512
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:16,200
Oh, God!

1513
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,140
Help!

1514
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,420
Wait, sir!

1515
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:33,050
Sir, open the gate, please!

1516
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:34,470
Help us, please!

1517
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:35,880
Help us!

1518
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:37,220
- Please!
- Please!

1519
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:40,220
Bloody hell!

1520
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:47,900
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1521
02:04:48,230 --> 02:04:49,560
Go, go!

1522
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:50,820
Jesus.

1523
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:52,900
- Please!
- Come on!

1524
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:54,400
Hurry!

1525
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,320
Come on!

1526
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:02,660
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1527
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:06,080
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1528
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,920
Don't leave! Please,
send for help!

1529
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,600
I got it! Which
one is it, Rose?

1530
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:31,940
The short one.
Try the short one.

1531
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:33,940
Hurry, Jack.

1532
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:39,280
Oh no! It won't go in.

1533
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,200
Hurry, Jack.

1534
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:45,700
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1535
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,620
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1536
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:51,960
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

1537
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:56,630
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

1538
02:05:57,630 --> 02:05:58,970
Go! Go!

1539
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:13,650
Jack! Come on!

1540
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:17,150
Move, move.

1541
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,830
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1542
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,670
Hold it! Hold it!

1543
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,340
Hold it!

1544
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:51,520
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1545
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,530
Mommy!

1546
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:13,290
Keep going up!

1547
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:18,050
Stop pushing!

1548
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:21,550
Stay back!

1549
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,300
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1550
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:27,050
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1551
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:28,310
Bastard!

1552
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,060
Get back!

1553
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:31,310
We had a deal, damn you!

1554
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:37,730
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1555
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:38,860
Get back!

1556
02:07:40,070 --> 02:07:41,990
Women and children only!

1557
02:07:50,910 --> 02:07:52,250
No, Tommy!

1558
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:11,970
No, Will!

1559
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:20,360
Now stand back, damn you!

1560
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:27,200
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1561
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,540
I have a child!

1562
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,000
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1563
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:43,380
Please, I have a child!

1564
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:46,880
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1565
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:48,890
Go on.

1566
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:50,220
Step back!

1567
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,060
- Please?
- Here, give her to me.

1568
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:54,180
You're all right, dearie.

1569
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:58,350
Give her here.

1570
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:01,270
There, there.

1571
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:08,410
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1572
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:11,910
Oh, Rose.

1573
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:16,250
Won't you even
make a try for it?

1574
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:22,750
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1575
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:26,920
It's going fast.
We have to move.

1576
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,220
Wait.

1577
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,720
Good luck to you, Rose.

1578
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:35,770
And to you.

1579
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,780
Mr. Guggenheim?

1580
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:51,410
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1581
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,620
No, thank you.

1582
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:56,660
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1583
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:59,420
But we would like a brandy.

1584
02:10:00,130 --> 02:10:02,630
Get the falls over here now!

1585
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,760
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1586
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:12,140
Capitán?

1587
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,970
Capitán, where should I go? Please.

1588
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:24,320
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1589
02:10:54,810 --> 02:10:57,010
Right. That's it, then.

1590
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:59,480
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1591
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,690
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1592
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:21,430
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years...

1593
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,930
in the land of Tir na nog...

1594
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:27,610
Land of eternal
youth and beauty.

1595
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:04,310
There's no time!

1596
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:05,850
Cut those falls!

1597
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,270
Cut them!
Cut them if you have to!

1598
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:11,650
I need a knife!

1599
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:14,990
Cut the falls now!

1600
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:16,990
Cut them loose!

1601
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,330
Cut those bloody falls!

1602
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:18,340
Gentlemen...

1603
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:21,510
it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1604
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,200
We have to stay on the
ship as long as possible.

1605
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:25,370
Come on!

1606
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:39,090
This way. Through the rail.

1607
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,680
Come on, Rose.

1608
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:44,010
Jump.

1609
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:47,430
Come on.

1610
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:22,300
I got you. Jump.

1611
02:16:24,970 --> 02:16:26,800
I've got you, miss.

1612
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:31,810
Back!

1613
02:17:02,010 --> 02:17:03,670
No! You'll swamp us!

1614
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:19,520
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

1615
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:22,610
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1616
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:14,410
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1617
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:17,540
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1618
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:19,330
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1619
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:20,500
This way.

1620
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,930
Come on!

1621
02:18:42,610 --> 02:18:45,020
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth...

1622
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:48,780
for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away...

1623
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:51,450
and there was no more sea.

1624
02:18:57,950 --> 02:19:01,040
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1625
02:19:06,630 --> 02:19:08,130
And He shall dwell with them.

1626
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:12,720
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

1627
02:19:13,050 --> 02:19:14,470
and be their God.

1628
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:16,310
Jack...

1629
02:19:17,310 --> 02:19:19,310
this is where we first met.

1630
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:29,570
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1631
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:31,990
and there shall be
no more death.

1632
02:19:32,490 --> 02:19:34,990
Neither shall there be
sorrow or crying.

1633
02:19:35,490 --> 02:19:37,990
Neither shall there
be any more pain...

1634
02:19:38,830 --> 02:19:41,580
for the former world
has passed away.

1635
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:58,350
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1636
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:22,960
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1637
02:20:58,910 --> 02:21:00,410
Hold on real tight.

1638
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:19,760
God Almighty.

1639
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:29,770
Keep those breakers in!
Keep them in!

1640
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:50,190
We have to move!

1641
02:22:56,110 --> 02:22:57,480
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

1642
02:22:57,530 --> 02:22:58,530
I can't.

1643
02:22:58,650 --> 02:22:59,650
Come on!

1644
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:00,780
Give me your hand.

1645
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:04,530
I've got you. I won't let go.

1646
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:06,160
Come on, I've got you.

1647
02:23:17,380 --> 02:23:20,550
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1648
02:23:29,730 --> 02:23:30,730
Hold on.

1649
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,270
This is it!

1650
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:29,950
Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1651
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,950
Hold on!

1652
02:24:46,970 --> 02:24:48,930
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1653
02:24:48,970 --> 02:24:51,180
Take a deep breath when I say.

1654
02:24:56,810 --> 02:24:58,980
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

1655
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:00,360
Do not let go of my hand.

1656
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:09,320
We're going to make it, Rose.

1657
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:10,370
Trust me.

1658
02:25:10,490 --> 02:25:11,740
I trust you.

1659
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:18,830
Ready! Ready!

1660
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,340
Now!

1661
02:25:56,710 --> 02:25:58,540
Jack! Jack!

1662
02:26:41,580 --> 02:26:42,580
Rose!

1663
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,420
Get off her! Get off her!

1664
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:51,300
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1665
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:57,770
Keep swimming.

1666
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,770
It's so cold.

1667
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:04,360
Swim, Rose!

1668
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:10,280
Come on.

1669
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:13,370
Keep swimming.

1670
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:14,950
Come on.

1671
02:27:16,910 --> 02:27:17,950
Here...

1672
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:19,250
get on it.

1673
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:21,460
Get on top.

1674
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,300
Come on, Rose.

1675
02:27:39,850 --> 02:27:41,520
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1676
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:08,880
It'll be all right now.

1677
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:17,390
Return...

1678
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,260
the boats!

1679
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:25,520
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

1680
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:27,520
Hold on just a
little bit longer.

1681
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:31,070
They had to row
away for the suction...

1682
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,360
but now they'll be coming back.

1683
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:37,740
For God's sake!

1684
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:39,240
Please...

1685
02:28:39,580 --> 02:28:40,870
help us!

1686
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:47,960
You don't understand.

1687
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:50,960
If we go back, they'll
swamp the boat.

1688
02:28:51,210 --> 02:28:52,550
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

1689
02:28:53,090 --> 02:28:55,590
Oh, knock it off.
You're scaring me.

1690
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:58,430
Come on, girls, grab
an oar. Let's go.

1691
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:01,890
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1692
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:05,440
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

1693
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,610
I don't understand a one of you.

1694
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:17,570
What's the matter with you?

1695
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:19,990
It's your men out there!

1696
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:24,120
There's plenty of room for more.

1697
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:26,080
And there'll be one less
on this boat...

1698
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:29,790
if you don't shut that
hole in your face!

1699
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:49,770
Now, bring in your oars over there.
And tie these boats together as well.

1700
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:56,490
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

1701
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:02,660
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1702
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:06,500
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

1703
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,790
as quick as you can, please.

1704
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:10,330
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

1705
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:22,180
It's getting quiet.

1706
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:27,680
It's just going to take a
couple of minutes...

1707
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:30,190
to get the boats organized.

1708
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:34,690
I don't know about you but...

1709
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:38,530
I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

1710
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:40,490
to the White Star Line
about all this.

1711
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:50,540
I love you, Jack.

1712
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:58,720
Don't you do that.

1713
02:31:00,220 --> 02:31:03,390
Don't you say your
good-byes. Not yet.

1714
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:05,220
Do you understand me?

1715
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:07,390
I'm so cold.

1716
02:31:07,890 --> 02:31:09,390
Listen, Rose...

1717
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,230
you're gonna get out of here.

1718
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:14,900
You're gonna go on...

1719
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:18,030
and you're gonna
make lots of babies.

1720
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:20,740
And you're gonna
watch them grow.

1721
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:23,530
You're gonna die an old...

1722
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:24,950
an old lady.

1723
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,910
Warm in her bed.

1724
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:29,700
Not here.

1725
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:33,080
Not this night. Not like this.

1726
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,080
Do you understand me?

1727
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:40,260
I can't feel my body.

1728
02:31:41,930 --> 02:31:43,380
Winning that ticket, Rose...

1729
02:31:43,550 --> 02:31:46,140
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1730
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:49,600
It brought me to you.

1731
02:31:51,230 --> 02:31:53,690
And I'm thankful
for that, Rose.

1732
02:31:54,230 --> 02:31:55,560
I'm thankful.

1733
02:31:59,030 --> 02:32:00,110
You must...

1734
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,240
you must do me this honor.

1735
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,740
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

1736
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:13,410
That you won't give up...

1737
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,580
no matter what happens.

1738
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:21,590
No matter how hopeless.

1739
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:26,930
Promise me now, Rose.

1740
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:31,430
And never let go
of that promise.

1741
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:34,440
I promise.

1742
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,230
Never let go.

1743
02:32:41,110 --> 02:32:43,240
I'll never let go, Jack.

1744
02:32:45,950 --> 02:32:47,620
I'll never let go.

1745
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:13,220
Right ahead, sir.

1746
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:17,900
Oars!

1747
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:20,060
Do you see any moving?

1748
02:33:21,070 --> 02:33:22,980
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1749
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:24,900
Check them.

1750
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:26,740
Bring that oar up here.

1751
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:34,410
Check them. Make sure.

1752
02:33:35,830 --> 02:33:37,460
These are dead, sir.

1753
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:39,130
Now, give way.

1754
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:40,630
Ahead easy.

1755
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:48,930
Careful with your oars.

1756
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:50,550
Don't hit them.

1757
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:55,430
Is there anyone
alive out there?

1758
02:33:56,940 --> 02:33:58,770
Can anyone hear me?

1759
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:03,270
Is there anyone
alive out there?

1760
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:11,320
We waited too long.

1761
02:34:15,250 --> 02:34:17,000
Well, keep checking them!

1762
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:18,790
Keep looking!

1763
02:34:19,630 --> 02:34:22,130
Is there anyone
alive out there?

1764
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:27,630
Can anyone hear me?

1765
02:34:38,810 --> 02:34:41,650
Come, Josephine...

1766
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:46,650
in my flying machine

1767
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:51,360
And it's up she goes

1768
02:34:53,330 --> 02:34:55,330
Up she goes

1769
02:35:00,830 --> 02:35:03,000
Come, Josephine...

1770
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:07,670
in my flying...

1771
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:33,130
Jack.

1772
02:35:52,550 --> 02:35:53,890
There's a boat.

1773
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:08,400
Jack.

1774
02:36:20,910 --> 02:36:22,910
There's a boat, Jack.

1775
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:08,630
Come back.

1776
02:37:19,970 --> 02:37:22,310
Come back. Come back!

1777
02:37:23,810 --> 02:37:25,310
Hello!

1778
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:29,310
Can anyone hear me?

1779
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:31,480
There's nothing here, sir.

1780
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:38,160
Come back.

1781
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,500
I'll never let go.

1782
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:49,080
I promise.

1783
02:38:32,170 --> 02:38:34,000
Come about!

1784
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:59,200
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

1785
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:02,530
when Titanic
sank from under us.

1786
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:07,540
There were twenty
boats floating nearby...

1787
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:11,040
and only one came back.

1788
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,000
One.

1789
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:18,380
Six were saved
from the water...

1790
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:20,550
myself included.

1791
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:23,010
Six...

1792
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:26,100
out of fifteen hundred.

1793
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:30,730
Afterward...

1794
02:39:31,900 --> 02:39:33,900
the seven hundred
people in the boats...

1795
02:39:34,690 --> 02:39:36,770
had nothing to do but wait.

1796
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:40,070
Wait to die.

1797
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:42,070
Wait to live.

1798
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:45,410
Wait for an absolution...

1799
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:47,740
that would never come.

1800
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:54,440
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

1801
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,020
It's all steerage.

1802
02:40:58,980 --> 02:41:02,530
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

1803
02:41:02,650 --> 02:41:04,030
White beard.

1804
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:06,110
Isn't there another
passenger list?

1805
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:07,280
There is no other list.

1806
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:08,870
Perhaps he's on another ship.

1807
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:10,990
We're doing all we can,
ma'am. I'm so sorry.

1808
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:37,020
That's the last time
I ever saw him.

1809
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:41,020
He married. Of course.
And inherited his millions.

1810
02:41:41,690 --> 02:41:45,190
But the Crash of '29 hit
his interests hard...

1811
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:47,820
and he put a pistol in
his mouth that year.

1812
02:41:48,370 --> 02:41:50,200
Or so I read.

1813
02:42:03,050 --> 02:42:04,510
Can I take your name
please, love?

1814
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:08,880
Dawson.

1815
02:42:11,050 --> 02:42:12,550
Rose Dawson.

1816
02:42:13,890 --> 02:42:15,060
Thank you.

1817
02:42:22,070 --> 02:42:24,190
We never found
anything on Jack.

1818
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:26,280
There's no record
of him at all.

1819
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:29,240
No, there wouldn't
be, would there?

1820
02:42:29,570 --> 02:42:32,280
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

1821
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,080
Not to anyone.

1822
02:42:35,250 --> 02:42:37,250
Not even your grandfather.

1823
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:41,580
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

1824
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:46,090
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

1825
02:42:46,420 --> 02:42:48,420
and that he saved me...

1826
02:42:48,760 --> 02:42:52,090
in every way that
a person can be saved.

1827
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:56,770
I don't even have
a picture of him.

1828
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:03,110
He exists now only
in my memory.

1829
02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:11,450
Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
way to the surface.

1830
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:30,760
I was saving this for when
I found the diamond.

1831
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:41,640
I'm sorry.

1832
02:43:44,310 --> 02:43:45,810
Three years...

1833
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:49,150
I've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

1834
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:51,820
But I never got it.

1835
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:56,830
I never let it in.
