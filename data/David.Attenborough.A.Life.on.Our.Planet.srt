1
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:24,795
This city in Ukraine was once home
to almost 50,000 people.

2
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,508
It had everything a community would need
for a comfortable life.

3
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:38,850
But on the 26th of April, 1986,
it suddenly became uninhabitable.

4
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:45,148
The nearby nuclear power station
of Chernobyl exploded.

5
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:53,740
And in less than 48 hours,
the city was evacuated.

6
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,454
No one has lived here since.

7
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:16,680
The explosion was a result of bad planning
and human error. Mistakes.

8
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:23,520
It triggered an environmental catastrophe
that had an impact across Europe.

9
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:29,943
Many people regarded it as the most costly
in the history of mankind.

10
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,407
But Chernobyl was a single event.

11
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,579
The true tragedy of our time
is still unfolding across the globe,

12
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,956
barely noticeable from day to day.

13
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,628
I'm talking about
the loss of our planet's wild places,

14
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,630
its biodiversity.

15
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:00,807
The living world is a unique
and spectacular marvel.

16
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:06,980
Billions of individuals, and millions
of kinds of plants and animals...

17
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:10,942
...dazzling in their variety and richness.

18
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,990
Working together to benefit
from the energy of the sun

19
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,618
and the minerals of the earth.

20
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:27,167
Leading lives that interlock in such a way
that they sustain each other.

21
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:34,633
We rely entirely on this finely tuned
life-support machine.

22
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:40,931
And it relies on its biodiversity
to run smoothly.

23
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:52,859
Yet the way we humans live on Earth now
is sending biodiversity into a decline.

24
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:02,869
This too is happening as a result
of bad planning and human error

25
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:07,624
and it too will lead
to what we see here.

26
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:14,339
A place in which we cannot live.

27
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,804
The natural world is fading.

28
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,724
The evidence is all around.
It's happened in my lifetime.

29
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:27,018
I've seen it with my own eyes.

30
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:32,357
This film is my witness statement
and my vision for the future,

31
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:36,737
the story of how we came to make this
our greatest mistake,

32
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,241
and how, if we act now,
we can yet put it right.

33
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:03,513
I am David Attenborough, and I am 93.

34
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:07,017
I've had the most extraordinary life.

35
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:11,563
It's only now that I appreciate
how extraordinary.

36
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,571
I've been lucky enough
to spend my life

37
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,073
exploring the wild places of our planet.

38
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,704
I've traveled to every part of the globe.

39
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:40,383
I've experienced the living world
firsthand in all its variety and wonder.

40
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:47,599
In truth, I couldn't imagine
living my life in any other way.

41
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:56,107
I've always had a passion to explore,
to have adventures,

42
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,236
to learn about the wilds beyond.

43
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,197
And I'm still learning.

44
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:07,744
As much now as I did when I was a boy.

45
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,639
It was a very different world back then.

46
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:33,812
We had very little understanding
of how the living world actually worked.

47
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,234
It was called natural history

48
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,195
because that's essentially
what it was all about...

49
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:44,906
history.

50
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,829
It was a great place to come to as a boy,

51
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:56,209
because this is, um, ironstone workings,
but it was disused.

52
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,295
All this was absolutely clear, it was...

53
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,463
only just stopped being a working quarry.

54
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:17,897
When I was a boy,
I spent all my spare time

55
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,650
searching through rocks
in places like this...

56
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,486
for buried treasure.

57
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Fossils.

58
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,578
It's a creature called an ammonite.

59
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,956
And in life the animal itself
lived in the chamber here

60
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,126
and spread out its tentacles
to catch its prey.

61
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,214
And it lived about 180 million years ago.

62
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:48,929
This particular one
has a scientific name of Tiltonicerus,

63
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,599
because the first one ever
was found near this quarry

64
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:55,477
here in Tilton, in the middle of England.

65
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:02,359
Over time, I began to learn something
about the earth's evolutionary history.

66
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,364
By and large, it's a story of slow,
steady change.

67
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:15,246
Over billions of years,
nature has crafted miraculous forms,

68
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,459
each more complex and accomplished
than the last.

69
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:25,173
It's an achingly intricate labor.

70
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:32,764
And then,
every hundred million years or so,

71
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,142
after all those painstaking processes,

72
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:41,314
something catastrophic happens,
a mass extinction.

73
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,029
Great numbers of species disappear
and are suddenly replaced by a few.

74
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,409
All that evolution undone.

75
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:58,039
You can see it. A line in the rock layers.

76
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:02,877
A boundary that marks a profound,
rapid, global change.

77
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:07,340
Below the line
are a multitude of lifeforms.

78
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,885
Above, very few.

79
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:19,686
A mass extinction has happened five times
in life's four-billion-year history.

80
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,732
The last time it happened

81
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:28,194
was the event that brought the end
of the age of the dinosaurs.

82
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:33,074
A meteorite impact triggered
a catastrophic change

83
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,285
in the earth's conditions.

84
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:42,375
75% of all species were wiped out.

85
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:49,299
Life had no option but to rebuild.

86
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:56,681
For 65 million years, it's been at work
reconstructing the living world...

87
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,022
until we come to the world we know...
our time.

88
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:15,241
Scientists call it the Holocene.

89
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:24,084
The Holocene has been
one of the most stable periods

90
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,294
in our planet's great history.

91
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:34,094
For 10,000 years, the average temperature
has not wavered up or down

92
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,387
by more than one degree Celsius.

93
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,853
And the rich and thriving
living world around us

94
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,981
has been key to this stability.

95
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:57,575
Phytoplankton at the ocean's surface
and immense forests straddling the north

96
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,705
have helped to balance the atmosphere
by locking away carbon.

97
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,460
Huge herds on the plains

98
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:12,715
have kept the grasslands rich
and productive by fertilizing the soils.

99
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:22,433
Mangroves and coral reefs
along thousands of miles of coast

100
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,520
have harbored nurseries of fish species

101
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:30,233
that, when mature,
then range into open waters.

102
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:41,828
A thick belt of jungles around the equator
has piled plant on plant

103
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:45,123
to capture as much of the sun's energy
as possible,

104
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:49,460
adding moisture and oxygen
to the global air currents.

105
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:56,843
And the extent of the polar ice
has been critical,

106
00:11:56,926 --> 00:12:00,096
reflecting sunlight
back off its white surface,

107
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,765
cooling the whole earth.

108
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:11,482
The biodiversity of the Holocene
helped to bring stability,

109
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:19,073
and the entire living world settled
into a gentle, reliable rhythm...

110
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:21,910
the seasons.

111
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,127
On the tropical plains,

112
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,424
the dry and rainy seasons would switch
every year like clockwork.

113
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:44,807
In Asia, the winds would create
the monsoon on cue.

114
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,071
In the northern regions, the temperatures
would lift in March, triggering spring,

115
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:04,369
and stay high until they dipped in October
and brought about autumn.

116
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,335
The Holocene was our Garden of Eden.

117
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,088
Its rhythm of seasons was so reliable

118
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:18,841
that it gave our own species
a unique opportunity.

119
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,180
We invented farming.

120
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,021
We learnt how to exploit the seasons
to produce food crops.

121
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:37,944
The history of
all human civilization followed.

122
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,574
Each generation able
to develop and progress

123
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:47,161
only because the living world
could be relied upon

124
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,706
to deliver us the conditions we needed.

125
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:58,131
The pace of progress was unlike anything
to be found in the fossil record.

126
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:05,930
Our intelligence changed the way
in which we evolved.

127
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,016
In the past,

128
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:14,188
animals had to develop some
physical ability to change their lives.

129
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:18,276
But for us, an idea could do that.

130
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:22,405
And the idea could be passed
from one generation to the next.

131
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:28,536
We were transforming
what a species could achieve.

132
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,047
A few millennia after this began,
I grew up at exactly the right moment.

133
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,260
The start of my career in my 20s

134
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:48,431
coincided with the advent
of global air travel.

135
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:53,436
So, I had the privilege of being
amongst the first

136
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,690
to fully experience the bounty of life
that had come about

137
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:00,360
as a result of
the Holocene's gentle climate.

138
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,008
Wherever I went, there was wilderness.

139
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,261
Sparkling coastal seas.

140
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:30,014
Vast forests.

141
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,601
Immense grasslands.

142
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:37,647
You could fly for hours
over the untouched wilderness.

143
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,862
And there I was, actually being asked
to explore these places

144
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:48,574
and record the wonders
of the natural world for people back home.

145
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,203
And to begin with, it was quite easy.

146
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,705
People had never seen pangolins
before on television.

147
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,499
They'd never seen sloths before.

148
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,793
They had never seen the center
of New Guinea before.

149
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,843
It was the best time of my life.

150
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:10,972
The best time of our lives.

151
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:15,893
The Second World War was over,
technology was making our lives easier.

152
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,191
The pace of change
was getting faster and faster.

153
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:31,117
It felt that nothing
would limit our progress.

154
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,246
The future was going to be exciting.

155
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,291
It was going to bring everything
we had ever dreamed of.

156
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:45,756
This was before any of us were aware
that there were problems.

157
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,858
My first visit to East Africa was in 1960.

158
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:13,367
Back then, it seemed inconceivable
that we, a single species,

159
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,956
might one day have the power to threaten
the very existence of the wilderness.

160
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:27,131
The Maasai word "Serengeti"
means "endless plains."

161
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,468
To those who live here,
it's an apt description.

162
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,220
You can be in one spot on the Serengeti,

163
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,973
and the place is totally empty of animals,

164
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,517
and then, the next morning...

165
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,187
...one million wildebeest.

166
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,904
A quarter of a million zebra.

167
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,410
Half a million gazelle.

168
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:01,123
A few days after that...

169
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,795
and they're gone... over the horizon.

170
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,966
You can be forgiven for thinking
that these plains are endless

171
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,760
when they could swallow up such a herd.

172
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,429
It took a visionary scientist,

173
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:19,183
Bernhard Grzimek,
to explain that this wasn't true.

174
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:27,900
He and his son used a plane
to follow the herds over the horizon.

175
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,997
They charted them
as they moved across rivers,

176
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,250
through woodlands,
and over national borders.

177
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,838
They discovered that the Serengeti herds

178
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,843
required an enormous area
of healthy grassland to function.

179
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:59,432
That without such an immense space,
the herds would diminish

180
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,477
and the entire ecosystem
would come crashing down.

181
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:09,483
The point for me was simple:
The wild is far from unlimited.

182
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,486
It's finite. It needs protecting.

183
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,616
And a few years later,
that idea became obvious to everyone.

184
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:22,955
Five, four,
three, two one, zero.

185
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:29,629
I was in a television
studio when the Apollo mission launched.

186
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:35,092
It was the first time

187
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,888
that any human had moved away
far enough from the earth

188
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,806
to see the whole planet.

189
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:44,310
And this is what they saw...

190
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,981
what we all saw.

191
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,321
Our planet, vulnerable and isolated.

192
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,956
One of the extraordinary things about it
was that the world

193
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,793
could actually watch it as it happened.

194
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:15,508
It was extraordinary that you could see
what a man out in space could see

195
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,677
as he saw it at the same time.

196
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:23,307
And I remember very well that first shot.

197
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,560
You saw a blue marble,

198
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:33,109
a blue sphere in the blackness,
and you realized that that was the earth.

199
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:37,571
And in that one shot, there was
the whole of humanity with nothing else

200
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:42,201
except the person that was
in the spacecraft taking that picture.

201
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:47,998
And that completely changed
the mindset of the population,

202
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,709
the human population of the world.

203
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,464
Our home was not limitless.

204
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,719
There was an edge to our existence.

205
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:05,516
It was a rediscovery
of a fundamental truth.

206
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:10,813
We are ultimately bound by
and reliant upon

207
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:14,108
the finite natural world about us.

208
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,905
This truth defined the life we led
in our pre-history,

209
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,534
the time before farming and civilization.

210
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,329
Even as some of us
were setting foot on the moon,

211
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:32,918
others were still leading such a life
in the most remote parts of the planet.

212
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:46,557
In 1971, I set out to find
an uncontacted tribe in New Guinea.

213
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:56,776
These people were hunter-gatherers,
as all humankind had been before farming.

214
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:04,158
They lived in small numbers
and didn't take too much.

215
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,915
They ate meat rarely.

216
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:16,378
The resources they used
naturally renewed themselves.

217
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:22,009
Working with their traditional technology,
they were living sustainably,

218
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:26,472
a lifestyle that could continue
effectively forever.

219
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,770
It was a stark contrast
to the world I knew.

220
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:37,191
A world that demanded more every day.

221
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:51,455
I spent the latter half of the 1970s
traveling the world,

222
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,876
making a series I had long dreamed of
called Life on Earth,

223
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:01,382
the story of the evolution of life
and its diversity.

224
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,469
It was shot in 39 countries.

225
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,140
We filmed 650 species,

226
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,644
and we traveled
one and a half million miles.

227
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,772
That's the sort of commitment you need

228
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,776
if you want to even begin
making a portrait of the living world.

229
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,862
But it was noticeable

230
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:27,116
that some of these animals
were becoming harder to find.

231
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,884
When I filmed with the mountain gorillas,

232
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:50,973
there were only 300 left
in a remote jungle in Central Africa.

233
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,893
Baby gorillas were at a premium,

234
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:58,188
and poachers would kill
a dozen adults to get one.

235
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,486
I got as close as I did only because
the gorillas were used to people.

236
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,577
The only way to keep them alive
was for rangers to be with them every day.

237
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:23,047
The process of extinction that I'd seen
as a boy... in the rocks,

238
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:28,302
I now became aware was happening
right there around me

239
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,513
to animals with which I was familiar.

240
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,017
Our closest relatives.

241
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,564
And we were responsible.

242
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,944
It revealed a cold reality.

243
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,531
Once a species became our target,

244
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,535
there was now nowhere on earth
that it could hide.

245
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:12,763
Whales were being slaughtered by fleets
of industrial whaling ships in the 1970s.

246
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,145
The largest whales, the blues,

247
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,856
numbered only a few thousand by then.

248
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,197
They were virtually impossible to find.

249
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:38,664
We found humpbacks off Hawaii
only by listening out for their calls.

250
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,583
A moment ago, we made this recording

251
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:45,587
with an underwater microphone
here in the Pacific near Hawaii.

252
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:46,839
Just listen to this.

253
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,771
Recordings like these revealed
that the songs of the humpbacks

254
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,982
are long and complex.

255
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:10,195
Humpbacks living in the same area
learn their songs from each other.

256
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:16,744
And the songs have distinct themes
and variations which evolve over time.

257
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,464
Their mournful songs were the key

258
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:31,425
to transforming people's opinions
about them.

259
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,682
Hello, Boctok.
We are Canadian.

260
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,060
Please stop killing the whales.

261
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,940
Animals
that had been viewed

262
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,235
as little more than
a source of oil and meat

263
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,988
became personalities.

264
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,993
We are men
and women, and we speak for children,

265
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:02,956
and we're all saying,
"Please stop killing the whales."

266
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,338
We have pursued animals to extinction
many times in our history,

267
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:14,676
but now that it was visible,
it was no longer acceptable.

268
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:27,147
The killing of whales
turned from a harvest to a crime.

269
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,611
A powerful shared conscience
had suddenly appeared.

270
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:37,157
Nobody wanted animals to become extinct.

271
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:41,495
People were coming to care
for the natural world...

272
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:46,124
as they were made aware
of the natural world.

273
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,757
And we now had the means to make
people across the world aware.

274
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:07,187
By the time Life on Earth
aired in 1979, I had entered my 50s.

275
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,816
There were twice the number
of people on the planet

276
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,151
as there were when I was born.

277
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:21,159
You and I belong to the most widespread
and dominant species of animal on earth.

278
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:24,329
We're certainly the most numerous
large animal.

279
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,667
There are something like
4,000 million of us today,

280
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,588
and we've reached this position
with meteoric speed.

281
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:37,009
It's all happened
within the last 2,000 years or so.

282
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:41,471
We seem to have broken loose
from the restrictions

283
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:45,475
that have governed the activities
and numbers of other animals.

284
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,027
We had broken loose.

285
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,656
We were apart
from the rest of life on earth,

286
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:03,660
living a different kind of life.

287
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,250
Our predators had been eliminated.

288
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,756
Most of our diseases were under control.

289
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:21,220
We had worked out
how to produce food to order.

290
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,850
There was nothing left to restrict us.

291
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,603
Nothing to stop us.

292
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,898
Unless we stopped ourselves...

293
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:38,654
we would keep consuming the earth
until we had used it up.

294
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,160
Saving individual species
or even groups of species

295
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,995
would not be enough.

296
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,415
Whole habitats would soon
start to disappear.

297
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:24,574
I first witnessed the destruction
of an entire habitat in Southeast Asia.

298
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:30,664
In the 1950s, Borneo was three-quarters
covered with rainforest.

299
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,375
We heard
a crashing in the branches ahead.

300
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,379
And there, only a few yards away,

301
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:42,342
we spotted a great furry red form
swaying in the trees.

302
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,636
The orangutan.

303
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,808
By the end of the century,

304
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:54,062
Borneo's rainforest
had been reduced by half.

305
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,780
Rainforests are particularly
precious habitats.

306
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,536
More than half of the species
on land live here.

307
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:19,212
They're places in which
evolution's talent for design soars.

308
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:09,846
Many of the millions of species
in the forest exist in small numbers.

309
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:15,811
Every one has a critical role to play.

310
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:24,903
Orangutan mothers have to spend
ten years with their young,

311
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:28,782
teaching them which fruits
are worth eating.

312
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,537
Without this training,

313
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,374
they would not complete their role
in dispersing seeds.

314
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:43,296
The future generations
of many tree species would be at risk.

315
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:48,802
And tree diversity is the key
to a rainforest.

316
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,517
In a single small patch
of tropical rainforest,

317
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,812
there could be
700 different species of tree,

318
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,566
as many as there are
in the whole of North America.

319
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:09,990
And yet, this is what we've been
turning this dizzying diversity into.

320
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,536
A monoculture of oil palm.

321
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:22,294
A habitat that is dead in comparison.

322
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:30,427
And you see this curtain of green
with occasionally birds in it,

323
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,306
and you think it's perhaps okay.

324
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:35,807
But if you get in a helicopter,

325
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,227
you see that
that is a strip about half a mile wide.

326
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,688
And beyond that strip,

327
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:47,027
there is nothing but regimented rows
of oil palms.

328
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,998
There is a double incentive
to cut down forests.

329
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,710
People benefit from the timber...

330
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:08,590
and then benefit again from
farming the land that's left behind.

331
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:27,943
Which is why we've cut down
three trillion trees across the world.

332
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:32,447
Half of the world's rainforests
have already been cleared.

333
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,708
What we see happening today

334
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:48,838
is just the latest chapter
in a global process spanning millennia.

335
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,183
The deforestation of Borneo
has reduced the population of orangutan

336
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:05,647
by two-thirds since I first saw one
just over 60 years ago.

337
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,657
We can't cut down rainforests forever,

338
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,412
and anything that we can't do forever is
by definition unsustainable.

339
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,541
If we do things that are unsustainable,

340
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:30,672
the damage accumulates ultimately to
a point where the whole system collapses.

341
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:36,052
No ecosystem,
no matter how big, is secure.

342
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:41,683
Even one as vast as the ocean.

343
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:51,026
This habitat was the subject
of the series The Blue Planet,

344
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,737
which we were filming in the late '90s.

345
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:13,131
It was... an astonishing vision
of a completely unknown world,

346
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:17,344
a world that had existed
since the beginning of time.

347
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,855
All sorts of things that you had no idea
had ever existed,

348
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:33,234
all in a multitude of colors,
all unbelievably beautiful.

349
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:42,035
And all of them completely undisturbed
by your presence.

350
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:54,339
For much of its expanse,
the ocean is largely empty.

351
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:59,594
But in certain places, there are hot spots

352
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,389
where currents bring nutrients
to the surface

353
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:05,725
and trigger an explosion of life.

354
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:15,568
In such places,
huge shoals of fish gather.

355
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,246
The problem is that our fishing fleets

356
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,583
are just as good at finding
those hot spots as are the fish.

357
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,924
When they do, they're able to gather
the concentrated shoals with ease.

358
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:45,223
It was only in the '50s that large fleets

359
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,768
first ventured out
into international waters...

360
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:53,273
to reap the open ocean harvest
across the globe.

361
00:37:55,525 --> 00:38:00,363
Yet, they've removed
90% of the large fish in the sea.

362
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:11,666
At first, they caught
plenty of fish in their nets.

363
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,545
But within only a few years,

364
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:19,924
the nets across the globe
were coming in empty.

365
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,429
The fishing quickly became so poor

366
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:29,517
that countries began to subsidize
the fleets to maintain the industry.

367
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:38,193
Without large fish
and other marine predators,

368
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:41,529
the oceanic nutrient cycle stutters.

369
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:52,999
The predators help to keep nutrients
in the ocean's sunlit waters,

370
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:57,712
recycling them so that they can be used
again and again by plankton.

371
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:03,802
Without predators,

372
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:07,096
nutrients are lost for centuries
to the depths

373
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,391
and the hot spots start to diminish.

374
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:14,062
The ocean starts to die.

375
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:23,947
Ocean life was also
unravelling in the shallows.

376
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,872
In 1998, a Blue Planet film crew

377
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,292
stumbled on an event
little known at the time.

378
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,299
Coral reefs were turning white.

379
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:51,850
The white color is caused
by corals expelling algae

380
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:55,019
that lives symbiotically
within their body.

381
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:03,736
When you first see it,

382
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,949
you think perhaps that it's beautiful,
and suddenly you realize it's tragic.

383
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,286
Because what you're looking at
is skeletons.

384
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,788
Skeletons of dead creatures.

385
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,550
The white corals are ultimately
smothered by seaweed.

386
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:31,890
And the reef turns from wonderland...
to wasteland.

387
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:40,189
At first, the cause of the bleaching
was a mystery.

388
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:44,986
But scientists started to discover that
in many cases where bleaching occurred,

389
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,572
the ocean was warming.

390
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,574
For some time,

391
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:53,202
climate scientists had warned
that the planet would get warmer

392
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:57,290
as we burned fossil fuels
and released carbon dioxide

393
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,752
and other greenhouse gasses
into the atmosphere.

394
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,507
A marked change in atmospheric carbon

395
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:10,136
has always been incompatible
with a stable earth.

396
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,766
It was a feature
of all five mass extinctions.

397
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:20,855
In previous events,

398
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:25,693
it had taken volcanic activity
up to one million years

399
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,571
to dredge up enough carbon
from within the earth

400
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,531
to trigger a catastrophe.

401
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:36,329
By burning millions of years' worth
of living organisms

402
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:39,624
all at once as coal and oil,

403
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:43,753
we had managed to do so in less than 200.

404
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:50,176
The global air temperature had been
relatively stable till the '90s.

405
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,721
But it now appeared this was
only because the ocean

406
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:58,476
was absorbing much of the excess heat,
masking our impact.

407
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,940
It was the first indication to me

408
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,652
that the earth was beginning
to lose its balance.

409
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:18,329
The most remote habitat of all

410
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:22,291
exists at the extreme north
and south of the planet.

411
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,758
I've visited the polar regions
over many decades.

412
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,766
They've always been a place
beyond imagination...

413
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,562
with scenery unlike
anything else on earth...

414
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:49,318
and unique species
adapted to a life in the extreme.

415
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,366
But that distant world is changing.

416
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:03,458
In my time, I've experienced
the warming of Arctic summers.

417
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,171
We have arrived at locations

418
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:12,383
expecting to find expanses of sea ice
and found none.

419
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,513
We've managed to travel by boat

420
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:21,100
to islands that were impossible
to get to historically

421
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:24,145
because they were
permanently locked in the ice.

422
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:32,236
By the time Frozen Planet aired in 2011,

423
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,448
the reasons for these changes
was well established.

424
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:43,915
The ocean has long since
become unable to absorb

425
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:48,169
all the excess heat
caused by our activities.

426
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:52,298
As a result, the average
global temperature today

427
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:56,844
is one degree Celsius warmer
than it was when I was born.

428
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:07,647
A speed of change that exceeds
any in the last 10,000 years.

429
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:20,785
Summer sea ice in the Arctic
has reduced by 40% in 40 years.

430
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,748
Our planet is losing its ice.

431
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:37,552
This most pristine and distant
of ecosystems is headed for disaster.

432
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,906
Our imprint is now truly global.

433
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:02,827
Our impact now truly profound.

434
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,288
Our blind assault on the planet

435
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:10,001
has finally come to alter
the very fundamentals of the living world.

436
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:23,598
We have overfished 30% of fish stocks
to critical levels.

437
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:30,521
We cut down
over 15 billion trees each year.

438
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:37,778
By damming, polluting,
and over-extracting rivers and lakes,

439
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:43,534
we've reduced the size
of freshwater populations by over 80%.

440
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,955
We're replacing the wild with the tame.

441
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:57,465
Half of the fertile land on earth
is now farmland.

442
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:09,727
70% of the mass of birds
on this planet are domestic birds.

443
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:13,230
The vast majority, chickens.

444
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:22,406
We account for over one-third
of the weight of mammals on earth.

445
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:27,578
A further 60% are the animals
we raise to eat.

446
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:38,005
The rest, from mice to whales,
make up just 4%.

447
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:44,136
This is now our planet,

448
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,515
run by humankind for humankind.

449
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:51,185
There is little left
for the rest of the living world.

450
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:00,653
Since I started filming in the 1950s,

451
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:06,325
on average, wild animal populations
have more than halved.

452
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,456
I look at these images now
and I realize that,

453
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,043
although as a young man
I felt I was out there in the wild

454
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,714
experiencing the untouched
natural world...

455
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:21,424
it was an illusion.

456
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:28,681
Those forests and plains and seas
were already emptying.

457
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,731
Um, so, the world
is not as wild as it was.

458
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:41,527
Well, we've destroyed it.
Not just ruined it.

459
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,948
I mean, we have completely...
well, destroyed that world.

460
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:49,243
That non-human world is gone.

461
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,664
Uh... The... Human beings
have overrun the world.

462
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,251
That is my witness statement.

463
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:44,757
A story of global decline
during a single lifetime.

464
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,014
But it doesn't end there.

465
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:56,018
If we continue on our current course,

466
00:48:56,102 --> 00:49:00,231
the damage that has been
the defining feature of my lifetime

467
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:04,735
will be eclipsed by the damage
coming in the next.

468
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:21,001
Science predicts that were I born today,

469
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:24,296
I would be witness to the following.

470
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:35,558
The Amazon Rainforest, cut down until
it can no longer produce enough moisture,

471
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:38,853
degrades into a dry savannah,

472
00:49:39,436 --> 00:49:42,231
bringing catastrophic species loss...

473
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,861
and altering the global water cycle.

474
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:58,414
At the same time,
the Arctic becomes ice-free in the summer.

475
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,210
Without the white ice cap,

476
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:07,006
less of the sun's energy
is reflected back out to space.

477
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,886
And the speed of global warming increases.

478
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:24,148
Throughout the north,
frozen soils thaw, releasing methane,

479
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:29,320
a greenhouse gas many times more potent
than carbon dioxide,

480
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:34,533
accelerating the rate
of climate change dramatically.

481
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:46,086
As the ocean continues to heat
and becomes more acidic,

482
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,381
coral reefs around the world die.

483
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,930
Fish populations crash.

484
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:10,653
Global food production enters a crisis
as soils become exhausted by overuse.

485
00:51:19,787 --> 00:51:22,122
Pollinating insects disappear.

486
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:28,003
And the weather is
more and more unpredictable.

487
00:51:33,676 --> 00:51:37,513
Our planet becomes
four degrees Celsius warmer.

488
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:43,894
Large parts of the earth
are uninhabitable.

489
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,942
Millions of people rendered homeless.

490
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:56,282
A sixth mass extinction event...

491
00:51:57,366 --> 00:51:59,118
is well underway.

492
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:09,336
This is a series of one-way doors...

493
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:13,173
bringing irreversible change.

494
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:17,761
Within the span of the next lifetime,

495
00:52:18,637 --> 00:52:21,890
the security and stability
of the Holocene,

496
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:25,394
our Garden of Eden...

497
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:28,397
will be lost.

498
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:43,704
Right now, we're facing a manmade disaster
of global scale.

499
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:47,374
Our greatest threat in thousands of years.

500
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,960
If we don't take action,

501
00:52:50,544 --> 00:52:53,047
the collapse of our civilizations

502
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:59,261
and the extinction of much of
the natural world is on the horizon.

503
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,555
But the longer we leave it,

504
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:05,559
the more difficult it'll be
to do something about it.

505
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,187
And you could happily retire.

506
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:16,028
But you now want to explain to us
what peril we are in.

507
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:23,994
And, in a way, I wish I wasn't
involved in this struggle.

508
00:53:25,162 --> 00:53:27,831
Because I wish the struggle
wasn't there or necessary.

509
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:32,586
But I've had unbelievable luck
and good fortune.

510
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:38,133
Um, and I certainly
would feel very guilty...

511
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:44,515
if I saw what the problems are
and decided to ignore them.

512
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:49,937
Climbing over the tightly-packed bodies

513
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,356
is the only way across the crowd.

514
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:56,527
Those beneath can get crushed to death.

515
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:19,216
We are facing nothing less
than the collapse of the living world.

516
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:24,471
The very thing that gave birth
to our civilization.

517
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:30,185
The thing we rely upon
for every element of the lives we lead.

518
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:35,649
No one wants this to happen.

519
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,528
None of us can afford for it to happen.

520
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,867
So, what do we do?

521
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:48,871
It's quite straightforward.

522
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,666
It's been staring us
in the face all along.

523
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:57,337
To restore stability to our planet,

524
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:00,883
we must restore its biodiversity.

525
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:05,596
The very thing that we've removed.

526
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:13,937
It's the only way out of this crisis
we have created.

527
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:20,152
We must rewild the world.

528
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:03,987
Rewilding the world is simpler
than you might think.

529
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,365
And the changes we have to make

530
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:10,410
will only benefit ourselves
and the generations that follow.

531
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:15,874
A century from now,
our planet could be a wild place again.

532
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,544
And I'm going to tell you how.

533
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:32,224
Every other species on Earth reaches
a maximum population after a time.

534
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,813
The number that can be sustained
on the natural resources available.

535
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:42,234
With nothing to restrict us,

536
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:46,655
our population has been growing
dramatically throughout my lifetime.

537
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,616
On current projections,

538
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:55,414
there will be 11 billion people
on Earth by 2100.

539
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,083
But it's possible to slow,

540
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:03,463
even to stop population growth
well before it reaches that point.

541
00:57:08,218 --> 00:57:10,178
Japan's standard of living

542
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:13,849
climbed rapidly in the latter half
of the 20th century.

543
00:57:15,142 --> 00:57:17,978
As healthcare and education improved,

544
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:21,565
people's expectations
and opportunities grew,

545
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,984
and the birth rate fell.

546
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:31,283
In 1950, a Japanese family was likely
to have three or more children.

547
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:36,455
By 1975, the average was two.

548
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,211
The result is that the population
has now stabilized

549
00:57:43,295 --> 00:57:46,506
and has hardly changed
since the millennium.

550
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:52,262
There are signs that this has started
to happen across the globe.

551
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:59,603
As nations develop everywhere,
people choose to have fewer children.

552
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:07,402
The number of children being born
worldwide every year

553
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,113
is about to level off.

554
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:14,743
A key reason the population
is still growing

555
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:17,371
is because many of us are living longer.

556
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:21,667
At some point in the future,

557
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:26,380
the human population will peak
for the very first time.

558
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:29,132
The sooner it happens,

559
00:58:29,216 --> 00:58:32,803
the easier it makes everything else
we have to do.

560
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:40,143
By working hard
to raise people out of poverty,

561
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:43,563
giving all access to healthcare,

562
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:49,027
and enabling girls in particular
to stay in school as long as possible,

563
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:53,198
we can make it peak sooner
and at a lower level.

564
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,494
Why wouldn't we want to do these things?

565
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,705
Giving people
a greater opportunity of life

566
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:01,915
is what we would want to do anyway.

567
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:06,753
The trick is to raise
the standard of living around the world

568
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:10,298
without increasing
our impact on that world.

569
00:59:10,382 --> 00:59:11,967
That may sound impossible,

570
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,803
but there are ways
in which we can do this.

571
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:28,025
The living world
is essentially solar-powered.

572
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,195
The earth's plants

573
00:59:32,279 --> 00:59:37,284
capture three trillion kilowatt-hours
of solar energy each day.

574
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:44,666
That's almost 20 times the energy
we need... just from sunlight.

575
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:52,507
Imagine if we phase out fossil fuels

576
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:57,971
and run our world on the eternal energies
of nature too.

577
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:04,061
Sunlight, wind, water and geothermal.

578
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,319
At the turn of the century,

579
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:18,325
Morocco relied on imported oil and gas
for almost all of its energy.

580
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,080
Today, it generates
40% of its needs at home

581
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:30,462
from a network of renewable power plants,
including the world's largest solar farm.

582
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:36,093
Sitting on the edge of the Sahara,

583
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:39,805
and cabled directly into southern Europe,

584
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:46,812
Morocco could be an exporter
of solar energy by 2050.

585
01:00:53,568 --> 01:01:00,283
Within 20 years, renewables are predicted
to be the world's main source of power.

586
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:04,538
But we can make them the only source.

587
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:11,878
It's crazy that our banks and our pensions
are investing in fossil fuel...

588
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:14,631
when these are the very things

589
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:18,343
that are jeopardizing the future
that we are saving for.

590
01:01:21,096 --> 01:01:24,599
A renewable future
will be full of benefits.

591
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,562
Energy everywhere will be more affordable.

592
01:01:29,855 --> 01:01:32,858
Our cities will be cleaner and quieter.

593
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:37,237
And renewable energy will never run out.

594
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:58,383
The living world can't operate without
a healthy ocean and neither can we.

595
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:10,020
The ocean is a critical ally in our battle
to reduce carbon in the atmosphere.

596
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:17,360
The more diverse it is,
the better it does that job.

597
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,508
And, of course, the ocean is important
to all of us as a source of food.

598
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:46,723
Fishing is world's greatest wild harvest.

599
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:50,101
And if we do it right, it can continue...

600
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:54,564
because there's a win-win at play.

601
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,609
The healthier the marine habitat,

602
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:01,655
the more fish there will be,
and the more there will be to eat.

603
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,832
Palau is a Pacific Island nation

604
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:17,754
reliant on its coral reefs
for fish and tourism.

605
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:24,302
When fish stocks began to reduce,

606
01:03:24,386 --> 01:03:28,556
the Palauans responded
by restricting fishing practices

607
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,477
and banning fishing
entirely from many areas.

608
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,526
Protected fish populations
soon became so healthy,

609
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:43,196
they spilt over into the areas
open to fishing.

610
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:49,828
As a result,

611
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:54,165
the "no fish" zones have increased
the catch of the local fishermen,

612
01:03:54,249 --> 01:03:58,420
while at the same time
allowing the reefs to recover.

613
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,929
Imagine if we committed to
a similar approach across the world.

614
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:14,102
Estimates suggest that "no fish" zones
over a third of our coastal seas

615
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:19,024
would be sufficient to provide us
with all the fish we will ever need.

616
01:04:24,738 --> 01:04:26,614
In international waters,

617
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:32,329
the UN is attempting to create
the biggest "no fish" zone of all.

618
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:38,209
In one act,
this would transform the open ocean

619
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:42,088
from a place exhausted
by subsidized fishing fleets

620
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:47,886
to a wilderness that will help us all
in our efforts to combat climate change.

621
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:52,265
The world's greatest wildlife reserve.

622
01:05:08,907 --> 01:05:10,992
When it comes to the land,

623
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:14,746
we must radically reduce the area
we use to farm,

624
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:17,665
so that we can make space
for returning wilderness.

625
01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:22,796
And the quickest and most effective way
to do that is for us to change our diet.

626
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:31,137
Large carnivores are rare in nature

627
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:34,891
because it takes a lot of prey
to support each of them.

628
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:44,651
For every single predator
on the Serengeti,

629
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:47,821
there are more than 100 prey animals.

630
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:54,202
Whenever we choose a piece of meat,

631
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:59,416
we too are unwittingly demanding
a huge expanse of space.

632
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:09,342
The planet can't support
billions of large meat-eaters.

633
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:11,594
There just isn't the space.

634
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:19,227
If we all had a largely plant-based diet,

635
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:24,023
we would need only half the land
we use at the moment.

636
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:29,612
And because we would be
then dedicated to raising plants,

637
01:06:29,696 --> 01:06:33,491
we could increase the yield
of this land substantially.

638
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:44,419
The Netherlands is one of the world's
most densely-populated countries.

639
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:50,842
It's covered with small family-run farms
with no room for expansion.

640
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:59,309
So, Dutch farmers have become expert
at getting the most out of every hectare.

641
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:05,356
Increasingly,
they're doing so sustainably.

642
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:14,908
Raising yields tenfold in two generations
while at the same time using less water,

643
01:07:15,575 --> 01:07:21,164
fewer pesticides, less fertilizer
and emitting less carbon.

644
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,170
Despite its size,

645
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:32,717
the Netherlands is now the world's
second largest exporter of food.

646
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:43,228
It's entirely possible for us to apply
both low-tech and hi-tech solutions

647
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:46,981
to produce much more food
from much less land.

648
01:07:49,192 --> 01:07:52,779
We can start to produce food
in new spaces.

649
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,159
Indoors, within cities.

650
01:08:01,496 --> 01:08:04,832
Even in places
where there's no land at all.

651
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:21,015
As we improve our approach to farming,

652
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:25,228
we'll start to reverse the land-grab
that we've been pursuing

653
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:27,397
ever since we began to farm,

654
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:34,195
which is essential because we have
an urgent need for all that free land.

655
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:46,457
Forests are a fundamental component
of our planet's recovery.

656
01:08:48,084 --> 01:08:52,797
They are the best technology nature has
for locking away carbon.

657
01:08:54,549 --> 01:08:57,468
And they are centers of biodiversity.

658
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,642
Again, the two features work together.

659
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,271
The wilder and more diverse forests are,

660
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:12,817
the more effective they are
at absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.

661
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:19,240
We must immediately
halt deforestation everywhere...

662
01:09:20,116 --> 01:09:26,789
and grow crops like oil palm and soya
only on land that was deforested long ago.

663
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:30,585
After all, there's plenty of it.

664
01:09:32,754 --> 01:09:34,880
But we can do better than that.

665
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:44,223
A century ago, more than three quarters
of Costa Rica was covered with forest.

666
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:58,196
By the 1980s, uncontrolled logging
had reduced this to just one quarter.

667
01:10:01,074 --> 01:10:03,034
The government decided to act,

668
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:08,039
offering grants to land owners
to replant native trees.

669
01:10:12,502 --> 01:10:14,629
In just 25 years,

670
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:20,093
the forest has returned to cover
half of Costa Rica once again.

671
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:29,560
Just imagine if we achieve this
on a global scale.

672
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:34,607
The return of the trees would absorb

673
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,777
as much as two thirds
of the carbon emissions

674
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,989
that have been pumped into the atmosphere
by our activities to date.

675
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,290
With all these things,

676
01:10:51,874 --> 01:10:54,544
there is one overriding principle.

677
01:10:57,463 --> 01:11:02,802
Nature is our biggest ally
and our greatest inspiration.

678
01:11:05,138 --> 01:11:09,142
We just have to do what nature
has always done.

679
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:15,022
It worked out the secret of life long ago.

680
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:24,907
In this world,
a species can only thrive...

681
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:30,329
when everything else
around it thrives, too.

682
01:11:36,294 --> 01:11:39,130
We can solve the problems we now face

683
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:42,175
by embracing this reality.

684
01:11:44,844 --> 01:11:47,263
If we take care of nature,

685
01:11:48,765 --> 01:11:51,768
nature will take care of us.

686
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:59,942
It's now time for our species
to stop simply growing.

687
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:07,241
To establish a life on our planet
in balance with nature.

688
01:12:10,077 --> 01:12:12,580
To start to thrive.

689
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,837
When you think about it,
we're completing a journey.

690
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,467
Ten thousand years ago,
as hunter-gatherers,

691
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:29,514
we lived a sustainable life
because that was the only option.

692
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:36,020
All these years later,
it's once again the only option.

693
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:38,397
We need to rediscover...

694
01:12:39,482 --> 01:12:41,108
how to be sustainable.

695
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:45,112
To move from being apart from nature

696
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:49,784
to becoming a part of nature once again.

697
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:57,792
Tonight, we've got
a rather different program for you.

698
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:03,923
If we can change
the way we live on Earth,

699
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:07,760
an alternative future comes into view.

700
01:13:11,347 --> 01:13:12,849
In this future,

701
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:19,897
we discover ways to benefit from our land
that help, rather than hinder, wilderness.

702
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:27,572
Ways to fish our seas that enable them
to come quickly back to life.

703
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:38,666
And ways to harvest
our forests sustainably.

704
01:13:42,295 --> 01:13:49,051
We will finally learn how to work
with nature rather than against it.

705
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:56,183
In the end, after a lifetime's exploration
of the living world,

706
01:13:56,267 --> 01:13:58,561
I'm certain of one thing.

707
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:02,440
This is not about saving our planet...

708
01:14:03,316 --> 01:14:05,902
it's about saving ourselves.

709
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:16,996
The truth is, with or without us,
the natural world will rebuild.

710
01:14:26,923 --> 01:14:31,177
In the 30 years
since the evacuation of Chernobyl,

711
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:35,473
the wild has reclaimed the space.

712
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:50,821
Today, the forest has taken over the city.

713
01:15:04,752 --> 01:15:09,465
It's a sanctuary for wild animals
that are very rare elsewhere.

714
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:21,227
And powerful evidence
that however grave our mistakes,

715
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:24,689
nature will ultimately overcome them.

716
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:32,071
The living world will endure.

717
01:15:34,115 --> 01:15:37,868
We humans cannot presume the same.

718
01:15:40,705 --> 01:15:42,248
We've come this far

719
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:46,168
because we are the smartest creatures
that have ever lived.

720
01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:55,636
But to continue,
we require more than intelligence.

721
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,433
We require wisdom.

722
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:18,367
There are many differences between humans
and the rest of the species on earth,

723
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:24,248
but one that has been expressed is that
we alone are able to imagine the future.

724
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:29,545
For a long time, I and perhaps you
have dreaded that future.

725
01:16:30,546 --> 01:16:35,134
But it's now becoming apparent
that it's not all doom and gloom.

726
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,637
There's a chance for us to make amends,

727
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:43,100
to complete our journey of development,
manage our impact,

728
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:47,855
and once again become a species
in balance with nature.

729
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:51,692
All we need is the will to do so.

730
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:57,073
We now have the opportunity to create
the perfect home for ourselves,

731
01:16:57,615 --> 01:17:03,662
and restore the rich, healthy,
and wonderful world that we inherited.

732
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,499
Just imagine that.
