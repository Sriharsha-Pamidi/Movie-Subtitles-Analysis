## Movie Subtitles Analysis



### Introduction:
Movies and Television series have always played an important role in the entertainment
industry. They include a variety of crafts such as cinematography, direction, screenplay, writing
and so on, as well as a variety of genres. We attempt to understand some of the driving factors
in making a successful film using the script and the interactions between the characters as
these are the most crucial elements of the movie. We also seek to comprehend some of the
specific traits or properties that are required for success in each genre and understand the
driving forces behind some of the most popular television and film series, as well as the
recurring elements that have contributed to their success.


### Implementation:
We collected .srt subtitles files from various sources, extracted the dialogues associated
with the movie time, and performed sentiment analysis on them in order to comprehend the
various emotions expressed throughout the film. The data is then analyzed to determine the
factors that contribute to a film's success as measured by its imdb rating. To observe the
similarities and statistically significant factors, we used techniques such as correlation
analysis and hypothesis testing. We investigated various trends in the data across
different films. Following that, we concluded our observations in movie scripts
derived from subtitles in the report.
